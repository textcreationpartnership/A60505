            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

<pb facs="tcp:31257:3"/> to them, and without any Partition; and the Title therefore and the Sections are put to them by another, when they came hither.

                  <p>HAving done my Book, there is one thing you are to underſtand, or I am farther to acquaint you with, that whereas my Adverſaries charge me with contradicting our <hi>Reformers,</hi> and being one with the <hi>Papiſts;</hi> they cannot make good the charge, and therefore 'tis a ſlander. For our <hi>Reformers,</hi> what they writ upon the point was againſt the <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts,</hi> who contended for Juſtification by inherent Grace and good Works, as a Conformity to the violated Law; <hi>i. e.</hi> the Law of Innocency, and alſo that this Righteouſneſs was in its own Nature
<pb facs="tcp:31257:5"/> 
                     <hi>Meritorious</hi> of Juſtification and Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; but here, or in this I do as much op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe the <hi>Papiſts</hi> as our <hi>Reformers,</hi> and ſo am one with them in this reſpect in the point, ſo far am I from contradict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them: So that if the Perſons my reſolved Adverſaries will have me to be one with the <hi>Papiſts</hi> and againſt our <hi>Reformers,</hi> when I affirm that Faith in Chriſt is the <hi>qualifying,</hi> though not the <hi>meriting</hi> matter of our <hi>Juſtification,</hi> or that which is the Qualification, giving right to Chriſt and his purchaſed ſaving benefits which follow hereupon, they muſt prove that it is ſo accounted by me, as it is a Conformity to that Law which requires ſinleſs perfect Works, and condemns for non-performance of the ſame, and alſo to be meritorious of Life according to that Law, or elſe all they ſay contradicts not me, and if not, then all their noiſe is but a beating the Air, and ſo to no purpoſe, ſeeing they are quite off from the matter in queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. The <hi>Papiſts</hi> affirm that the Law of God may be perfectly kept in this
<pb facs="tcp:31257:5"/> Life, and that they intend the Law in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joining perfect ſinleſs Works, is manifeſt; ſeeing that our <hi>Proteſtants</hi> in oppoſition aſſert, that no mortal Man is able to keep the Law of God perfectly in this Life, and that it is no way poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible to keep the ſame perfectly; for if Man by Grace (as the <hi>Papiſts</hi> ſay) might perform the Law, he might de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver himſelf by Grace from the Curſe; but now are we redeemed from the Curſe only by Chriſt who was <hi>made a Curſe for us,</hi> and again ſay they, if the Righteous Man keep the Law, then he is without Sin; for where there is no tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion of the Law there is no Sin but no Man is without Sin; ſo that the opinion of the <hi>Papiſts</hi> upon the point is, that the <hi>uniea formalis cauſa Juſtificationis, est juſtitia Dei, qua nos juſtos facit, quam quiſque in ſe recipit. i. e.</hi> The only formal cauſe of our Juſtification is the Righteouſneſs of God, whereby we are not <hi>reputed</hi> juſt, but are <hi>made</hi> juſt indeed, This is the Righteouſneſs which a Man hath within himſelf, and is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herent
<pb facs="tcp:31257:6"/> in him, and this juſtice or Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs it is plain they account an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>act Conformity to the Law which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires perfect ſinleſs Works; for they teach that it is not only poſſible for Men to keep the Law of God in this Life but to do more than is preſcribed or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded; in that Men of their abundance may allot unto others ſuch works of ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erogation. Theſe therefore who bring me into ſuch worthy company as Mr. <hi>Baxter,</hi> Mr. <hi>Humfrey,</hi> Mr. <hi>Clerk,</hi> whom they charge with Popery, as they do me, in the Doctrine of Juſtification, becauſe they affirm a practical Faith to be the <hi>qualifying</hi> matter of right to Chriſt, and his ſaving purchaſed benefits which fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low thereupon; when every where they deny it to be the <hi>meriting</hi> matter, aſſert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that to be <hi>Chriſt's Righteouſneſs</hi> and his only, do manifeſtly wrong and ſlander them and me, for before our Adverſaries can make us one with the <hi>Papiſts</hi> upon the matter in Queſtion; <hi>i e.</hi> in the point of Juſtification, they have to prove that we hold theſe following things.
<pb facs="tcp:31257:6"/> (1.) That a Man in this Life by the Grace of God received, may be perfectly conform'd to that Law which requires ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs Works. (2.) That Grace and good Works in their own nature conſidered as inherent do juſtifie. (3.) That they do ſo in the account of the above mentioned Law which injoins ſinleſs Works. (4.) That the ſame Law which requires ſinleſs Works, is the Inſtrument of our Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, or that by which God doth judge or account Perſons righteous upon their Conformity thereunto, and ſo juſtifies them by it. Now theſe things are ſo far from being holden by us, as that we op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe them more than any of our Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries, who account themſelves ſuch great Antipapiſts, yea and are further of from the <hi>Papiſts</hi> herein than they, for upon the principles our Adverſaries go in the point, it cannot be avoided but they make that Law which injoins perfect ſinleſs Works (which as ſuch condemns us all) to be God's Inſtrument whereby he juſtifies, ſeeing that they ſay the matter of their perſonal juſtifying Righteouſneſs (not
<pb facs="tcp:31257:7"/> only <hi>meriting,</hi> but <hi>qualifying,</hi> or elſe they oppoſe not us, obſerve that) muſt be that which is every way perfect in the ſenſe of the violated Law of Innocency: And indeed were we to be juſtified by that Law we muſt ſay the ſame with them. So that let any Man who is not altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther prejudiced againſt the cauſe, judge whether thoſe Men be not much nearer the <hi>Papiſts</hi> in this point than ſuch as they charge to be one with them: for the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verend Perſons named above, and others with them, proceed in this point upon another Principle, then either the <hi>Papiſts</hi> or ſuch as profeſs to be their Adverſaries; holding God's Covenant or Law of Grace, to be the rule of judgment, and ſo the Inſtrument by which God doth juſtifie us, or that by which God doth juſtifie for the ſake of Chriſt's ſatisfactory and meritorio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Righteouſneſs, when by the Grace of God we are conformed thereunto, which Conformity conſiſts in a turn from Sin, and an unfeigned conſent ſincerely to be Obedient unto Chriſt and his Law to our Lives end; upon which God doth
<pb facs="tcp:31257:7"/> account or reckon us Righteous in the ſenſe of the Goſpel, and ſo ſuch who have that right unto and intereſt in Chriſt, (which impenitent and diſobedient Souls have not) and this for the Righteouſneſs ſake of Chriſt, as I have ſufficiently proved. And whereas (Readers) ſome Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons would bear you in hand that we give Repentance and Faith the place, Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice and uſe of Chriſt's Righteouſneſs, and look to be juſtified only by this as inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent; 'tis either an Ignorant or Malicious ſlander: for we ſay that although the Lord Jeſus hath ſatisfied offended Juſtice and merited all ſaving priviledges, yet we can neither have peace with God nor right to Chriſt, nor his purchaſed benefits, nor be accepted of God through Chriſt, until we be qualified with that Grace the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel requires, which Grace doth not give us the right in its own Nature, or as it is <hi>inherent,</hi> but as God accounts and reckons it to do ſo; that is, as he imputes it for Righteouſneſs. The <hi>Papiſts</hi> place Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication in the <hi>Infuſion:</hi> We in the <hi>Imputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi> Whatever you hear therefore from
<pb facs="tcp:31257:8"/> Adverſaries or read in any Books, that is, or ſhall be an indeavour to prove theſe forementioned Perſons, or others of their mind to be one with the <hi>Papiſts</hi> in the point of Juſtification, you may aſſure your ſelves 'tis nothing but a ſlander; and the ſlanderers are nearer themſelves in the point to the <hi>Papiſts,</hi> until they have fully proved, that we whom they abuſe, do hold the four particulars I have mentioned above, which I am ſure they cannot do ſo long as they have a Tongue to ſpeak with, and if they cannot, all their at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts againſt us are in vain, and not to be regarded: for if they do not this, they do nothing to invalidate our Doctrine, and therefore I deſire you Readers, to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve this, that if any Anſwer be made to mine, that you will ſee whether in the pretended Anſwer, it be proved that I hold the four things above mentioned; and if you find they prove not that (which they are not like) you may aſſure your ſelves their Anſwer is none.</p>

                  <p>WHereas the Author of this Book ſeems warm againſt the Righteouſneſs of Chriſt being the <hi>formal cauſe</hi> of our <hi>Juſtification,</hi> and argues that if it be ſo, then it muſt be the Believer's proper perſonal Righteouſneſs (which thoſe Divines who ſay that Chriſt and the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever do ſo coaleſs into one Perſon, that his Righteouſneſs is transferred to them upon that account, muſt aſſert) and if it be his perſonal Righteouſneſs, his <hi>Perſon,</hi> being not ſeperable from his <hi>Nature,</hi> which is <hi>himſelf,</hi> then he muſt be the ſubject of Chriſt's Righteouſneſs, and conſequently it muſt be <hi>inherent</hi> in him as the ſubject thereof; the candid Reader is to obſerve<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Firſt, That he drives the Argument thus home for conviction only of his Adverſaries, who know that <hi>Imputed</hi> and <hi>Inherent</hi> is a Contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction: Secondly, That he underſtands well they need no driving to a conceſſion that his Righteouſneſs therefore is not, and cannot be the Believer's <hi>Phyſically,</hi> but they ſay <hi>Legally</hi> on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and by <hi>Imputation;</hi> nevertheleſs ſo long as they ſay it is <hi>imputed</hi> ſo as to be his <hi>formal</hi> Righteouſneſs, the Abſurdity remains: Thirdly, That to hold Chriſt's Righteouſneſs, to be the Believer's, or accounted his <hi>legally,</hi> or in a Law-ſenſe,
<pb facs="tcp:31257:9"/> ſo as God looks on him as having ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled all Righteouſneſs in Chriſt as our <hi>legal Perſon,</hi> is that Doctrine which Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> hath ſet himſelf to oppoſe in all his Books, as ſuch which <hi>ſubverts the Goſpel;</hi> and he that will go about to maintain it muſt Anſwer his Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, which I ſuppoſe cannot be done by any: Laſtly, That if the more Judicious of his Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſaries would conſider a little more of the matter, and come to be content with ſuch an Imputation of Chriſt's Obedience as anſwers the End of his performance of it, which is that upon our believing Men ſhall enjoy the bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits, then would they ſoon find out the right knowledge how to give a fair conſtruction of what is ſaid by former Divines, who agreeing in this, that there is indeed an Imputation of Chriſt's Righteouſneſs to the Believers, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is not expreſs in Scripture, they not conſidering or mentioning any ſuch diſtinction, are miſconſtrued to underſtand an Imputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion <hi>in ſe,</hi> when there is indeed (or can be) no ſuch, but <hi>Quoad fructus aut Effectus</hi> only.</p>

                     <head>SECT. I. The Subject Matter propoſed.</head>
                     <p>SEeing the apprehenſions of Perſons are ſo dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent about the Doctrine and Nature of Juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, and ſo much depends upon the having a right notion hereof: At the intreaty of ſome of my Friends, for their ſatisfaction, and for the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit of others, I ſhall (God aſſiſting) with all poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble plainneſs declare my Sentiments in this particular.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. I do believe that by and through the ſatisfactory and meritorious Righteouſneſs of our Redeemer the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, a Covenant of Grace hath been pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſed for, and granted by God unto ſinners, after they by their ſin had violated or broken that Law which injoined perfect ſinleſs works, and thereby made
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:31257:10"/> themſelves incapable of performing obedience to that Law, which at the firſt it required as a condition of life, and ſo of having Juſtification thereby. <hi>Heb.</hi> 12. 24. Chriſt is called the Mediatour of the new Covenant, and that becauſe he hath purchaſed by his death a grant of pardon and life by promiſe for ſinners upon their ſincere repentance and faith. There are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes of pardon and everlaſting life to ſinners that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent and believe, <hi>Acts</hi> 3. 19. <hi>John</hi> 3. 16. Now for any to affirm that theſe promiſes are made, and the grace promiſed granted to ſinners who repent and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, without regard had by God unto Chriſt, as the purchaſer of them by his meritorious ſatisfactory righteouſneſs; is for them to affirm, that God grants and gives ſaving grace to penitent ſinners which Chriſt never purchaſed nor merited, and this is for none but the <hi>Socinian</hi> to hold.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. This Law or Covenant of Grace thus purchaſed and granted, injoins ſinners faith in Chriſt, which faith is never without repentance nor ſincere obedience, if the believer be continued after the gift of faith; for undoubtedly if the believer live in this World after the gift of faith, ſo long as he doth live, through the grace of God he continues obedient, 1 <hi>John</hi> 3. 23. <hi>Matt.</hi> 21. 30. <hi>Heb.</hi> 5. 9.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. Chriſt by his righteouſneſs hath purchaſed and merited the Holy Spirit to work faith in the hearts of all thoſe ſinners who thereby are brought to believe, <hi>John</hi> 14. 26. <hi>John</hi> 15. 26. The Spirit is ſent by the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in Chriſt's name; and ſent by Chriſt from the Father. Let any one now prove, that what the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther gives in Chriſt's name, and what Chriſt ſends from the Father is not purchaſed and merited by him. And the Spirit is called the Spirit of Faith, <hi>i. e.</hi> the principal Efficient, or Author of it, 2 <hi>Corinth</hi> 4. 13.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. I believe that all thoſe who by the Grace and Spirit of Chriſt do ſincerely believe, ſhall for and upon the account of Chriſt's ſatisfaction and meritorious
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:31257:10"/> righteouſneſs be ſaved: but as for ſuch as live and die in infidelity they ſhall be <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>amned, notwithſtanding Chriſt's merits; and that becauſe they have rejected the remedy through their unbelief; I ſpeak of the Adult, <hi>John</hi> 3. 16. 18. 36.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. I do believe that as the firſt Covenant did require ſinleſs, perfect conſtant obedience, <hi>Galat.</hi> 3. 10: ſo this obedience performed by innocent <hi>Adam,</hi> would have been his juſtifying righteouſneſs, or that righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs upon which this Law or Covenant would have juſtified him, or given him a right to Life promiſed, which is all one with Juſtification, if confuſion can but be removed, and this without any regard had to the righteouſneſs of another, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10. 5.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. I believe that as the ſecond Covenant, <hi>i. e.</hi> the Covenant of Grace doth require true Faith; ſo where there is this true Faith, which is the righteouſneſs this Covenant calls for on the Sinner's part; this Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant doth as certainly juſtifie the ſinner thereupon; <hi>i. e.</hi> give him a right to Pardon and Life, as the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of works would have juſtified <hi>Adam,</hi> and given him a right to life, had he continued in the ſtate of integrity. Though obſerve, That it is with regard had to the righteouſneſs and ſatisfaction of Chriſt, that this Faith is accepted and accounted by God in the Covenant of Grace for a ſinner's perſonal juſtifying righteouſneſs, inſtead of that ſinleſs perfect righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs which the Covenant of Works injoined; And is not this wonderful Grace? I add, it is Faith in the ſenſe of the Goſpel giveth Sinners intereſt in Chriſt, and a right to all ſaving benefits he hath purchaſed and ſo merited; which right given by the Covenant of Grace is its juſtifying the Soul as God's moral Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Though ſtill I moſt firmly hold, that it is for the ſake of Chriſt alone and his righteouſneſs that the believing ſinner hath this right; and that this his Faith, which is the gift of God, is accepted as a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal righteouſneſs, inſtead of ſinleſs perfect obedience
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:31257:11"/> I do not ſay by the ſame Law; <hi>i. e.</hi> the Law of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocency or perfect works no, but by the Covenant of Grace which accepts of ſincerity inſtead of ſtrict le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal perfection. I deny then with abhorrence, that Faith is any ſuch thing, as a ſatisfactory and meritori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous righteouſneſs in whole or in part, ſuch a righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs being proper to our bleſſed Mediatour the Lord <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap>: But then I do not deny, but affirm that a true and living Faith is by God in the Goſpel conſtituted, that righteouſneſs which giveth ſinners right both to Chriſt and all the bleſſings of the Covenant of Grace. And grant me but according to Scripture, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. 21, 22. <hi>Rom.</hi> 4. 13. <hi>Philipp.</hi> 3 9. that Faith is a righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and ſuch a righteouſneſs as the Goſpel calls for, and that it giveth right according to the Goſpel pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe to Chriſt and his purchaſed benefits, and ſee then what ground there is to deny it the place of a juſtify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing righteouſneſs. I ask doth it give any intereſt in Chriſt, and right to the bleſſings he hath purchaſed? if not, then an Infidel muſt have as great an intereſt in Chriſt, and as much right to Pardon and Life as a believer. If you ſay, that Faith doth give intereſt in Chriſt and right to theſe bleſſings, then you ſay the ſame with me; <hi>i. e.</hi> that for the ſake of Chriſt God by the Goſpel hath conſtituted Faith to be our perſonal juſtifying righteouſneſs, or that which gives us intereſt in Chriſt, and an actual right to the bleſſings purcha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by, and promiſed through him, and this is the juſtification by Faith I intend, and all that I know of in and by the Goſpel.</p>
                     <p>Juſtification by all is acknowledged to be a Law term, if ſo then, the matter of Juſtification is <hi>jus ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cundum legem,</hi> a right in Law, and this right in Law reſults immediately from a conformity to that Law, and the conformity to that Law is the righteouſneſs which that Law requires: And the Legiſlator or Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maker juſtifying a perſon, is his judging, aſſerting, or accounting by this his Law a perſon upon his confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity

                     <p>If the matter ſtand thus then in the nature of Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, as is clear, none can be juſtified by the Law of Innocency, or that Law which injoins ſinleſs per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect works, for we can have no right in or by that Law to Pardon and Life; and that becauſe tha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

And if ſo, as is plain, then God the Legiſlator or Author of this Law doth not, cannot judge, aſſert, or account that any have a right in or by this Law to Pardon and Life, and ſo doth not, nor cannot juſtifie us by it, and if not, doth not, nor cannot account a perfect legal righteouſneſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>But are we? If it be ſaid, not in our ſelves, but in Chriſt we are, I anſwer, if not in our ſelves, then we are not, nor cannot be perſonally righteous, or righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous in our own perſons by a perfect legal righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and ſo according to your grant, the righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Chriſt is not nor cannot be our formal perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal righteouſneſs, ſeeing that, that is a perfect legal righteouſneſs. If it be ſaid we are perſonally righteous in the ſenſe of the Law of Innocency in Chriſt; then we muſt be righteous in our ſelves, and this contradicts the former, that we are not thus righteous in our ſelves; for how can a Man be righteous in his perſon, but he muſt be righteous in himſelf? Find me who can, the perſon of a Man without the nature of a Man? and further, to ſay we are perfectly legally righteous in another, ſuppoſe by imputation, or in
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:31257:12"/> God's account in our own Perſons, is to ſay that God accounts us to he perfectly legally righteous in our ſelves<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>Now then if Juſtification be a Law act, or the act of God as Legiſlator by his Law, and it is not, nor cannot be the act of God by the Law of Innocency: then we muſt either have another Law, and ſuch a righteouſneſs as is a conformity to that Law, or elſe we muſt have no Juſtification. And look what Law it is, conformity to which gives us for the ſake of Chriſt a right to Pardon and Life, that conformity muſt be our juſtifying righteouſneſs, and God by this Law doth judge, aſſert, or account (which is all one with <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

This Objection ſpeaks great Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance in the Objectors; 1. Of the nature of the two Covenants, <hi>i. e.</hi> the Covenant of Works, and the Covenant of Grace; and, 2. Of the nature of Juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, or juſtifying righteouſneſs as it is <hi>jus ſecundum legem,</hi> a right in Law: But to the Objection I Anſwer, If you ſpeak of Juſtification by the Law of Works, I grant it muſt be ſuch a righteouſneſs; but what do you hope to be juſtified by that Law? if ſo, you muſt not be offended if I tell you in the words of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle, <hi>you are fallen from grace,</hi> Galat. 5. 4. But if you ſpeak of Juſtification by the Goſpel, which is the Juſtification I plead for, and I hope ſhall ever ſtand by, then ſuch a righteouſneſs is not required, but faith is that righteouſneſs, as hath been proved; though ſtill this faith is neither accounted nor accept<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for a juſtifying righteouſneſs, but for the ſake of a ſinleſs perfect righteouſneſs; that is to ſay, the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs of Chriſt God man Mediatour, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. 24, 25, 26.</p>

But further for Anſwer, if by our own righteouſneſs be meant ſuch a righteouſneſs, of which we are the Efficient Cauſes or Authors, or the purchaſing meritorious Cauſe; I deny that faith is our own righteouſneſs, but if by our own righteouſneſs be meant ſuch a righteouſneſs as is the gift of God,
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:31257:13"/> and the fruit of Chriſt's Merits, and of which we as qualified Subjects are the performers, ſo I grant faith is our own righteouſneſs, and though we are juſtified by it, yet we are juſtified freely by Grace. <hi>Rom.</hi> 4. 16. <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2. 8. But the Objection may be retorted, when it is ſaid Chriſt's righteouſneſs in its ſelf, or in its own nature in our Juſtification is by God accounted our very <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

So that thoſe who are for this ſtrict im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation of Chriſt's righteouſneſs, muſt hold alſo Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication by their own righteouſneſs, or by a righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs which by God is accounted their own.</p>
                     <p>But again it may be ſaid, if we be juſtified by faith we muſt be juſtified by an inherent righteouſneſs and we are not. I Anſwer, if God's imputing or account<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by his Law or Covenant of Grace, faith for righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs, which is the form of Juſtification, be Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication by inherent righteouſneſs, then God's impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting Chriſt's righteouſneſs unto us for Juſtification, muſt be juſtifying us alſo by an inherent righteouſneſs, for the form is the ſame in both; and if it be the form that makes the juſtifying righteouſneſs inherent, then juſtifying righteouſneſs muſt be inherent in the one as well as the other. But the form ſpeaks that Juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is not by Faith abſolutely inhering.</p>
                     <p>But if it be ſaid further, that Chriſt is the ſubject of that righteouſneſs, which is our formal perſonal juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying righteouſneſs, but we are the ſubjects of Faith; I Anſwer, if the righteouſneſs of Chriſt be our for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal perſonal righteouſneſs, then whatever Chriſt be, we muſt however be the ſubjects of this righteouſneſs; and if ſo, it muſt be our inherent, as well as our im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted righteouſneſs.

And can any Man that is well in his Wits think, that Chriſt's perfectly Holy habits, acts, ſpotleſs
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:31257:14"/> ſufferings all in conjunction with his righteouſneſs as God, is the righteouſneſs, and the ſole righteouſneſs of every individual Believer and ſo inherent? if ſo, then every individual Believer muſt either be the <hi>proper</hi> ſubject of this righteouſneſs, and ſo it muſt not be Chriſt's at all, or elſe the <hi>common,</hi> and ſo it muſt be attributed to Chriſt and them as a generical, or ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fical Nature, let what part will be taken it is groſs and irrational: therefore we muſt (until further light) ſtick to this, that if God do account the righteouſneſs of Chriſt to be the very righteouſneſs of our Perſons, he muſt alſo account it to be the righteouſneſs of our Nature; for to ſay that <hi>Thomas</hi> is perſonally righteous by ſuch a righteouſneſs, and yet not righteous by it in his Nature, is to ſay that <hi>Thomas</hi> is a Perſon without the ſpecifical and individual Nature of Man, than which nothing can be more abſurd, ſeeing that the Nature goes to the conſtituting of the Perſon. There may indeed (as in Chriſt) be the individual Nature without the perſonality; but there cannot be the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon without the Nature. So that if Perſons will have the righteouſneſs of Chriſt (above deſcribed) to be the only formal righteouſneſs of their Perſons, it muſt alſo be the righteouſneſs of their Natures, and ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herent. And thus that which is called ſanctifying Grace, is taken away as needleſs; for if Perſons be righteous in their very Natures ſubjectively by the righteouſneſs of Chriſt, which (it is evident) they muſt be, if it be the formal righteouſneſs of their Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, it cannot be avoided, but in God's account, and ſo really and indeed they muſt be ſinleſs and perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Holy, unleſs they imagin the righteouſneſs of Chriſt to be imperfect: ſo that I have cleared this, that ſuch as hold the righteouſneſs of Chriſt in their Juſtification, is made by God, or accounted by him to be the very formal righteouſneſs of their Perſons, muſt alſo hold it to be the righteouſnſs of their Nature, and ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herent, and as ſuch themſelves to be the ſubjects of it.</p>

                     <p>Now it is no ſmall matter of wonder that Men ſhould be charging me and others with holding merit, and ſetting up our ſelves, and making Saviours of our own Duties, all which we deny: while they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves muſt hold merit and ſatisfaction in the ſtricteſt ſenſe in their own perſons, they expreſly affirming, they have a righteouſneſs to be the formal righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of their perſons, which hath this efficacy; and if this be not more groſs than ever any merit was that the Papiſts held, I will leave to any thinking un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prejudiced Perſon to determine. One would think Men profeſſing the Knowledge of Chriſt above many, bearing the name of Chriſtians, above all about them, ſhould know and acknowledge the righteouſneſs of Chriſt (above deſcribed) to be eſſential, and ſo pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to him as Mediatour; and how or after what man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner then this ſame righteouſneſs muſt be the perſonal righteouſneſs, and that only, of every particular Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever, I profeſs is ſtrange. But if it be ſaid, they af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm it to be the perſonal righteouſneſs of a Believer by God's Imputation. I Anſwer, God in this Impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation they ſpeak of, either communicates after ſome ſort the righteouſneſs of Chriſt, or he doth not, if he do, then it cannot be eſſential and proper to Chriſt;
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:31257:15"/> if he do not after any ſort communicate it, then how can it be the formal righteouſneſs of any Man's Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon? Can a Man's Perſon be righteous, with a righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs that is altogether incommunicable, except in its fruits and effects? Will God impute that ſame righteouſneſs to me, ſo as to account me to be only righteous formally in my Perſon by it, which he knows <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>I have made it appear, that if Chriſt's righteouſneſs be the formal righteouſneſs of our Perſons, then it muſt be the righteouſneſs of our Nature; if any con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradict it they muſt know, they have this to prove; <hi>i. e.</hi> that God in juſtifying <hi>Peter,</hi> or any other doth account them to be formally righteous by Chriſt's righteouſneſs as Perſons, but not as they are Men, and if ſo, then they muſt prove the Perſon is juſtified, but not the Man; or the Perſon is formally righteous with Chriſt's righteouſneſs, but not the Man: how this will be performed, if the proof of it be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken, I cannot tell.</p>
                     <p>But before I paſs this, I further urge, if Chriſt's righteouſneſs be the righteouſneſs of our Nature, which it muſt be if it be our formal perſonal righteouſneſs; then it muſt be a quality inhering, and if it be a quality inhering, then we are made the Subjects; and ſo we muſt have that which is proper unto, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeparable from ſuch a Subject; <hi>i. e.</hi> Chriſt, removed, and exiſting ſeperate from its own proper Subject, in this and the other Believer, which cannot be the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects thereof, no more than Chriſt's Body can be the Subject of the accidents of Bread and Wine in the Lord's Supper: Alas! alas, that Men ſhould be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counting the Popiſh Tranſubſtantiation ſuch a Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, and yet cannot nor will not ſee what they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:31257:15"/> are forming. And upon the matter, I would deſire it might be conſidered, whether there be any ſuch thing as a perſonal juſtifying righteouſneſs, the matter of which is not inherent.</p>
                     <p>But it may be further objected, if Faith be our for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal perſonal juſtifying righteouſneſs, is not the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference betwixt Juſtification and Sanctification hereby taken away, and ſo theſe two great priviledge which in Scripture are ſpoken of as really diſtinct confound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and jumbled into one?</p>
                     <p>By what hath been ſaid above, the Objectors if they will but conſider, are ſtrangely intanged in the briers of this Objection themſelves; aſſerting Chriſt's righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs to be their formal perſonal righteouſneſs, and ſo the righteouſneſs of their Natures, and ſo make the ſanctifying Grace of the Spirit of no uſe. But how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever for Anſwer to the Objection, I ſhall (I hope) make it appear, that although I affirm that Faith is our perſonal juſtifying Goſpel Righteouſneſs, and alſo own it to be a ſanctifying Grace; that Juſtification and Sanctification are yet diſtinct, and by this Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine not con<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>Faith then as ſanctifying is that which purifies the Heart, <hi>Acts</hi> 15 9. it is a renewing by the Spirit of the moral Image of God, conſiſting in Knowledge, Righteouſneſs and Holineſs; <hi>Coloſſ.</hi> 3. 10. <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4. 24. ſo that the Soul which was only carnally diſpoſed and inclined before, is having Spiritual Illumination, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed and inclined principally to embrace Spiritual Objects; and here we conſider Faith abſolutely as a change of the Nature. Faith as juſtifying gives a right to Chriſt, and for his Merits ſake to Pardon and Life, by virtue of God's gracious appointment in his Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of Grace, in his Imputation of it to give this right; and here I conſider Faith relatively as a change of the ſtate; <hi>i. e.</hi> the Sinner that before was a Child of Wrath, and an Heir of Hell, upon a ſincere Faith
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:31257:16"/> hath that relation changed, and is accounted by God for Chriſt's Righteouſneſs his Child by Adoption, and an Heir of Heaven and Eternal Life, <hi>John</hi> 1. 12. <hi>Galat.</hi> 3. 26. Faith as ſanctifying relates to Chriſt, as Phyſitian healing by his Spirit of Grace the ſinful diſtempered Soul: Faith as juſtifying relates to Chriſt as Rector and Judge, who by his Law of Grace here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>u<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="3 letters">

                        </gap> doth declare that Soul who was as a Criminal, was condemned in Law before, now to be pardoned, and to have right to everlaſting Life. There is as much difference betwixt Faith as it Sanctifies, and as it Juſtifies, as betwixt an healing Medicine, and a Title and Right in Law to Pardon and an Inheritance: So that as the ſame Perſon may have divers Offices, and may be diſtinguiſhed according to his Offices; ſo is the ſame Faith diſtinguiſhed as ſanctifying and juſtifying: The ſame Man may be both a Phyſitian, and a Judge; Now will any Man that is right in his Head ſay, that the adminiſtring of Phyſick, and the diſpenſing and executing of Law are both one, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe both performed by the ſame Perſon? Thoſe who accuſe me and others of confounding Juſtification and Sanctification, when we ſay that Faith is our perſonal juſtifying Righteouſneſs, according to God's gracious Conſtitution or Law, they themſelves ſay, that Faith doth not only Sanctifie, but that it is the Inſtrument of Juſtification. Now give me leave upon the Point to ask theſe Men, whether they themſelves do not make a difference betwixt Faith as it Sanctifies, and as it is an Inſtrument of Juſtification? if they ſay, yea they do; do not they then themſelves according to their own notion, diſtinguiſh of the ſame Faith as ſanctify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and as juſtifying in their Senſe; and ſeeing they will not call this a confounding of Juſtification and Sanctification, What reaſon have they to call our No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſo? when we conſider Faith as abſolute in Sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, and relative in Juſtification, as hath been cleared.</p>
                     <pb n="15" facs="tcp:31257:16"/>
                     <p>If this be ſo, then it may be ſaid, Sanctification muſt be before Juſtification; I Anſwer, They that make the Objection, ſay this as much as we, in caſe they will have Faith to be the Inſtrument of Juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; for ſurely Faith muſt be had before it can be an Inſtrument, unleſs they can prove a Man may uſe Hands that hath none. But however, ſince this is caſt in our way, we ſhall a little eſſay to clea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

                        </gap>. If we take Sanctification then for the very firſt Seeds of Grace, which in their own Nature have a virtue to diſpoſe and incline the Soul to a thankful acceptance of Chriſt; ſo that the real conſent of the Will is gained, thus Sanctification is before Juſtification: But if we take it for a more fixed and rooted habit of Grace, ſo it is after Juſtification. The Heart muſt be firſt diſpoſed and inclined to open to Chriſt, that ſo he may have it for his habitation before it will actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally open. Hence ſo ſoon as ever the Soul upon this diſpoſition doth give its conſent to accept of the Lord Jeſus to be its only Propitiation, Head and Teacher; the Sinner hath intereſt in him, and by virtue of the Goſpel promiſe hath an actual right unto the bleſſed benefits of Pardon and Life purchaſed by him. 'Tis ſaid of <hi>Lydia,</hi> the Lord opened her Heart, and ſo, <hi>Revel.</hi> 3. 20. But it may be ſaid, are not the firſt Seeds of Grace ſaving? I Anſwer, The Seeds of Grace conſidered as ſuch, they have an healing or ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving virtue in their own Nature; but they are not actually healing or ſaving to me, until they prevail againſt the corrupt ſinful diſpoſition and inclination of my Will. I know in what Soul ſo ever God Sows the Seeds of true Grace, thoſe Seeds ſhall prove healing and ſaving through Chriſt; they ſhall prevail againſt the ſinful corrupt diſpoſition of the Will, 1 <hi>Peter</hi> 1. 23. but they are not thus healing and ſaving to any Soul until they do ſo: Such a Medicine appointed for the recovering of Health, it hath an healing quality, but though it be taken, 'tis not actually healing to the
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:31257:17"/> Sick, until it prevail againſt the Diſtemper, and it is ſo with Grace. And thus it may be known in what Senſe Sanctification is before Juſtification.</p>
                     <p>Touching the gift of the firſt Grace, know there is much good purchaſed by Chriſt, and given without reſpect to any condition on Man's part, and thus the gift of the firſt Grace, God ordinarily by his Word <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

The former work was to prevail with the Soul for its conſent, but when prevailed with, then hath it an actual intereſt in and right unto Chriſt, and the ſaving bleſſings of the Covenant promiſed upon conſent. A Man that Courts a Woman for her Conſent to be his Wife, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till this be given by her, and ſhe actually give up her ſelf unto him to be his Wife; ſhe hath no intereſt in him as her Husband, nor intereſt in nor right unto any of his Goods as one in that relation, and thus it is in the Caſe before us. <hi>If any Man,</hi> ſaith Chriſt, <hi>hear my voice, and open the door, I will come in to him, and ſup with him, and he with me,</hi> Revel. 3. 20.</p>

If Chriſt's Righteouſneſs be imputed in it ſelf, then the Law of perfect ſinleſs Works muſt juſtifie us; for if God in our Juſtification do account the Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs of Chriſt in it ſelf to be our formal perſonal juſtifying Righteouſneſs, then he muſt account us to be ſuch as have a ſinleſs perfect habitual and active Righteouſneſs: for ſuch was the Righteouſneſs of Chriſt, and if God do account us to have ſuch a righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs as this in our own Perſons, then it muſt follow that the Law of Innocency muſt juſtifie us as well as it did Chriſt; for what ſhould hinder if we have the very ſame righteouſneſs which is Chriſts to be our formal perſonal righteouſneſs? and have it we muſt, if God do impute it unto us in it ſelf, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count it in that Imputation to be ſuch a righteouſneſs as formal and perſonal. And from hence we muſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicitly hold that God in our Juſtification doth account us to be as righteous as Chriſt, which ſome have had the Confidence to affirm, and all from this Doctrine; for I hope People are not to learn that Chriſt's righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs habitual and active was a perfect conformity to the Law of Innocency, and if we be ſuch in the Senſe of that, it accounting that what Chriſt was and did, we were and did in him, in point of conformity, then in this very account it juſtifies us.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. God muſt account us ſuch as are habitually and actively ſinleſs and Holy, ſuch as have neither Sin in our Nature and Life, for Chriſt was ſuch, and if we have the very ſame righteouſneſs perſonally which he had (which we muſt have if God account us, as they ſay, to have it) then how can we chuſe but be ſuch as have neither Sin in Nature nor Life.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. That follows which hath been aſſerted, and is yet aſſerted by ſome, God neither ſeeth nor can ſee Sin in his People; and indeed how ſhould it be, if he account them habitually, and actively ſinleſs and Holy, for where it is thus, there can be no Sin in their Natures, and if ſo, then no Sin of Omiſſion or Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:31257:19"/> in the Life, and if no Sin neither in Nature nor Life, how ſhould God ſee any?</p>
                     <p n="5">5. If we be ſuch as God accounts in our Juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to be both habitually and actively Holy and ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, then we need no Pardon, for there needs no Pardon where there is no Sin nor Fault, and if we who are juſtified have no Sin to Pardon, then there needs no Confeſſion of Sin, nor Repentance, nor Faith in Chriſt for Pardon, and ſo no Goſpel Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence; ſeeing we have the ſame legal Righteouſneſs (as they ſay) in God's account which Chriſt had, and ſo we muſt be juſtified by the Law of Works as he was; and thus the Goſpel and Covenant of Grace which offers Pardon to Sinners upon Confeſſion, Repentance, and Faith, becomes a meer nothing, and the whole frame of Chriſtianity is taken down. Well, but they may ſay we are not inherently righteous by Chriſt's Righteouſneſs; I Anſwer, if they be perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally righteous with Chriſt's righteouſneſs, they muſt be inherently righteous with the ſame, as I have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore manifeſted.</p>

If God impute the righteouſneſs of Chriſt unto us in it ſelf, and ſo in the Senſe of the violated Law of Innocency reckon us to have done what Chriſt did, and to have ſuffered what Chriſt ſuffered in our own Perſons, then he muſt reckon us ſuch as have per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed the very acts of Mediation and Redemption; for wherein did Chriſt's Mediation and Redemption conſiſt, but in his Obedience and Sufferings (I ſpeak of this his work upon Earth) which conſtituted his Active and Paſſive Righteouſneſs: And if ſo be that God in juſtifying of us do account us to have the very ſame righteouſneſs which Chriſt had for our formal perſonal righteouſneſs, then he muſt account us to have that which is and was a mediating and redeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing righteouſneſs, and ſo to have that of our own by his gift, as our very perſonal righteouſneſs whereby we may be Mediatours and Redeemers for our ſelves and others.</p>

If God impute the righteouſneſs of Chriſt in it ſelf, and account it our formal perſonal righteouſneſs, then it is only the righteouſneſs of Chriſt he imputes as Man: or the righteouſneſs of Chriſt as God man.

                     <p>IF I ſhould paſs on further to prove from Scripture that not Chriſt's Righteouſneſs in it ſelf, but Faith as it accepts of Chriſt, as offered in the Goſpel, is now a Sinners formal juſtifying Righteouſneſs before God, I ſhould have a large Field, and might multiply expreſs Scripture Texts for the Imputation of ſuch a Faith, but not one expreſs Text in all the Bible can be found for the Imputation of Chriſt's Righteouſneſs in it ſelf, nay nor implicit. Let us conſider a few Texts among many, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4. 3. Abraham <hi>believed God, and it was accounted unto him for righteouſneſs.</hi> What was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted unto him for Righteouſneſs? Well, ſay they, not Faith, but its Object; <hi>i. e.</hi> the Righteouſneſs of Chriſt. But pray where have we any ſuch word in the Text? and beſides here is the object of his faith ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs, and that is God, <hi>Abraham</hi> believed God, now if they will have not Faith but its Object to be counted for Righteouſneſs, then the words muſt be read thus, <hi>Abraham</hi> believed God, and God was counted unto him for Righteouſneſs, and if they will have Chriſt's Righteouſneſs brought in here, then we muſt read the words thus, <hi>Abraham</hi> believed God, and God was count<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed unto him Chriſt's Righteouſneſs for Righteouſneſs. I would deſire them to tell us what Senſe they can make of either reading? So Verſe 5th. <hi>But to him that worketh not but believeth in him that juſtifieth the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly, his Faith is counted for Righteouſneſs.</hi> And Verſe 9th, <hi>For we ſay that Faith was reckoned to</hi> Abraham <hi>for Righteouſneſs.</hi> The Scripture ſaith expreſly, <hi>Faith was counted, and Faith was reckoned for Righteouſneſs;</hi> they
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:31257:21"/> ſay nay, but by Faith is meant Chriſt's Righteouſneſs; now let any Man judge whether we are to believe the Scripture or them. Though let it ever be marked when I according to Scripture ſay Faith is counted, imputed or reckoned for Righteouſneſs. I do not (as I have ſaid) exclude the object Chriſt, or God in Chriſt, but ſay it is not Chriſt's Righteouſneſs in it ſelf that is accounted by God to be my formal perſonal Righteouſneſs, but that Faith which doth accept of the Lord Jeſus as offered in the Goſpel, this Faith gives me intereſt in him, and right to Pardon and Life, and as ſuch is my juſtifying righteouſneſs in the Senſe of the Goſpel, and that becauſe God by the Goſpel doth declare unto me, and aſſure me, that if I thus believe in Chriſt, I ſhall both be pardoned and ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſtingly ſaved. I muſt ſtill urge that Text, <hi>John</hi> 3. 16. <hi>For God ſo loved the World, that he gave his only be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten Son; that whoſoever believeth in him, ſhould not periſh, but have everlaſting Life,</hi> and let it I pray be well conſidered, for what can God's declaring and aſſuring by the Goſpel be, that I ſhall have theſe great benefits upon ſuch a Faith, but his juſtifying me thereupon, or his accounting by this his expreſs word my right to theſe bleſſings upon ſuch a believing.</p>
                     <p>But it will be ſaid, do you not bring Faith into the very matter of Juſtification?</p>
                     <p>I Anſwer, I ſhall diſtinguiſh of matter of right,</p>
                     <p n="1">1. There is the meriting <hi>purchaſing</hi> matter of right, and this is ſolely or only Chriſt's Righteouſneſs.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. There is the <hi>qualifying</hi> matter of right, and this is Evangelical Obedience included in Faith, ſeeing that without Faith it is impoſſible to pleaſe God, now if Perſons judge, when I ſay Evangelical obedience is the matter of right, that I intend the purchaſing merit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing matter of right, here they miſtake me. But if they judge when I affirm Evangelical Obedience to be the matter of right, that I only intend the qualifying matter, in this they bit right. As thus now, Perſons
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:31257:21"/> will grant me there are ſuch gracious benefits as theſe; <hi>i. e.</hi> Pardon, Reconciliation, Adoption, Acceptation of the ſervices of a real Chriſtian, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The purcha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing and meriting Righteouſneſs then of all theſe bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits is only the righteouſneſs of Chriſt.

                        </gap>y, which is mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtly repugnant to the Scripture. If not, then I muſt be a Perſon or Subject qualified with ſomething, that according to God's appointment muſt give me intereſt in and right unto, I mean an actual right unto theſe benefits which I had not while an Impenitent Infidel: And what muſt this be? not the Righteouſneſs of Chriſt, for that cannot be a qualification in me; and if not, then Faith and Repentance, by which of an impenitent Infidel, I come to be a penitent Believer. And this I would have obſerved, that thoſe which are againſt my notion; yet if they be true practical Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, their practice muſt and doth agree with my notion. To inſtance in one thing, I offer up Prayer and Supplication to God, they do the ſame, I know my Prayers will not be accepted in themſelves without a Mediatour, they know the ſame, I ſay here, I muſt have right to Chriſt as my Mediatour, by accepting of him and truſting unto him as ſuch, and pleading the promiſes of grace in his Name, they ſay the ſame. I ſay further, I may hope for acceptation of my Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers for his meritorious interceſſion, if I have the quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication requiſite, and that is Faith. Whatſoever, ſaith Chriſt, you ſhall ask in my name, believing ye ſhall receive; ſo that this Faith is not the merit of my acceptation, but the gracious qualification of my Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, without which I cannot have an intereſt in, or right unto (in this particular) Chriſt's interceſſion,
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:31257:22"/> ſeeing that is offered up with the Prayers of Saints, and theſe moſt certainly muſt be Believers. Now are not they of the ſame mind? ſee then if their practice do not agree with my notion more than their own. And it look's odd on't, that Men ſhould contend againſt that which muſt be found in their own Practice if they be true Believers.</p>
                     <p>Having proceeded thus far, my next undertaking ſhall be to examine a little their gloſs upon ſome of the main Texts they bring for the proof of this their rigid Imputation of Chriſt's Righteouſneſs.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. One is <hi>Pſalm</hi> 37. 1. <hi>Bleſſed is he whoſe tranſgreſſion is forgiven, whoſe ſin is covered.</hi> Here is the Pardon of Sin expreſs, but not a word of the Imputation of Chriſt's Righteouſneſs in it ſelf; it is ſaid indeed <hi>whoſe ſin is covered.</hi> But what can the meaning be, but that God for the ſake of Chriſt's Merits and Satisfaction ſo pardons Sin to a Penitent Believer, as that it ſhall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be brought in againſt him, or laid to his charge in judgment to his condemnation and everlaſting ſhame, and thus it is ſaid to be <hi>covered,</hi> and thus covered for Chriſt's Righteouſneſs.</p>
                     <p>But ſeeing that Chriſt's Righteouſneſs is the cover, How is it ſo in their Senſe? well, they ſay, as a Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment or Robe; if it cover then as a Garment or Robe, Will they ſay that properly, or that it is really, and in it ſelf a Garment or Robe; <hi>i. e.</hi> Phyſically ſo? ſurely no, for this would be groſs, to conceive it to be a Coat or Gown, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> if not properly a Garment or Robe, then improperly they muſt ſay it is ſo, and ſo comparatively in reſpect of it's uſe. A Robe or Garment then it may have theſe uſes, to cover our nakedneſs, to defend from cold and ſtorms, to keep our bodies warm, and to adorn: We will grant then that Chriſt's Righteouſneſs may be compared to a Robe or Garment in regard of theſe uſes, conſidered as ſatisfactory and meritorious. It is for this that a true penitent Believer having his Sins pardoned, ſhall be
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:31257:22"/> delivered from everlaſting ſhame; it is for this he ſhall be ſecured from the ſtorm of God's eternal wrath and diſpleaſure; it is for this he is adorned and beautified with the Graces and Gifts of the moſt Holy Spirit; it is for this that he hath all the Heart quickning influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences of the bleſſed Spirit. But then if I be a Believer, that I have it in it ſelf, and that it is of all theſe uſes to me, as it is accounted by God to be my formal perſonal Righteouſneſs, this I muſt deny; for if ſo, it muſt not be the Righteouſneſs which is Chriſts, and proper to him as Mediatour, for which a Believer ſhall be delivered from everlaſting ſhame, and ſecured from God's wrath, but the Righteouſneſs of Chriſt as it is a Chriſtian's formal perſonal Righteouſneſs, and ſo as a quality in himſelf; and it muſt not be the Graces of the Spirit, and ſo not God's moral Image wherewith the Soul of a true Chriſtian is adorned, nor the Holy Spirits influences whereby it is quickned; but only the Righteouſneſs of Chriſt imputed in it ſelf, and ſo accounted to be his formal perſonal Righteouſneſs: And if it be thus, then the Righteouſneſs of Chriſt as Mediatour, and the qu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ckning and ſanctifying operations of the Holy Spirit muſt be needleſs. For whatever is a Believer's formal perſonal Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs, it muſt not only be imputed unto him, but be a quality in him, as I have cleared above, that whatever is the formal Righteouſneſs of the Perſon, muſt be the Righteouſneſs of the Nature; if therefore the Righteouſneſs of Chriſt (as they ſay) be the formal Righteouſneſs of the Perſon, then that Perſon who is formally righteous by it, muſt be perfectly righteous, ſeeing Chriſt's Righteouſneſs in it ſelf, which they ſay, they have to be their perſonal Righteouſneſs is ſuch: And if ſo, what need of the Righteouſneſs of a Mediatour, or the graces and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluences of the Holy Spirit for a Chriſtian, he being perfectly righteous in his very Nature with Chriſt's
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:31257:23"/> Righteouſneſs? Now they will ſay this they will not own, and if not, then why do they own and ſtick by ſuch a Doctrine, which hath ſuch natural and unavoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able conſequences as theſe?</p>
                     <p>I would gladly have theſe Perſons conſider, whether they dare truſt to this Righteouſneſs of Chriſt for their Juſtification and Acceptation, as it is their formal per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal Righteouſneſs without any further regard had to Chriſt as Mediatour without them: if ſo, then what need of Chriſt's Mediation without them? if not, then they muſt have Chriſt's Mediation without them for the acceptation of Chriſt's Righteouſneſs up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them, and doth Chriſt's own Righteouſneſs ſtand in need of Chriſt's Mediation for its Acceptation? I know not how they can come off here, without ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther denying that a Perſon conſidered as juſtified needs Chriſt's Mediation, or accounting the Righteouſneſs of Chriſt upon them in the Senſe of the Law of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocency to be imperfect. Take the former, and they exclude Chriſt from being a Mediatour for a juſtified Perſon as ſuch: take the later, and they deſtroy their own Aſſertion, that there is no Juſtification but by a perfect legal Righteouſneſs, but I ſhall leave them in their own ſna<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     <head>SECT. IV. Reaſons againſt the Imputation of Faith, and for the Imputation of Chriſt's Righteouſneſs anſwered.</head>
                     <p>HAving ſpoken ſomething to the principal Texts urged for the ſtrict Imputation of Chriſt's righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs, and ſhewed that they can be no proof that Chriſt's righteouſneſs is our formal perſonal righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs; let us now hear what in reaſon may yet be ſaid againſt the Imputation of Faith.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. Say they, Faith is no Righteouſneſs, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore cannot be imputed for righteouſneſs. I Anſwer, If the Antecedent can be proved in that Senſe in which faith is called righteouſneſs, the Conſequent muſt be granted. But know, Conformity to the Law of Innocency that is a righteouſneſs, but faith is no ſuch righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs: Conformity to the Goſpel or Law of Grace that is a righteouſneſs, and faith is this righteouſneſs, it is a conformity unto the Goſpel command. <hi>John 3. 23. And this is his commandment, that we ſhould believe on the Name of his Son Jeſus Chriſt, and love one another, as he gave commandment.</hi> And it is expreſly ſaid to be counted for righteouſneſs, in the 4th of the <hi>Romans.</hi> Therefore if there be no righteouſneſs but what is a conformity to the Law of Innocency, ſo indeed faith is no righteouſneſs, ſeeing it is not a conformity to that Law, and thus the Antecedent would be true but know there is a righteouſneſs which is a confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity to the Goſpel Law, and faith is this righteouſneſs, ſeeing it is a conformity to this Law. And thus the Antecedent appears to be falſe, and ſo the Conſequent.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Say they, Faith is not our perſonal juſtifying righteouſneſs becauſe it is a work. I Anſwer, This Argument ſuppoſeth that there is no Juſtification by a perſonal righteouſneſs, and if no Juſtification by a perſonal righteouſneſs, then there muſt be no ſuch
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:31257:30"/> thing as a Juſtification of any Perſon at all; for if there be a Juſtification by a perſonal righteouſneſs, then there muſt be Juſtification by a work: for to tell of Juſtification by a perſonal righteouſneſs, and yet alſo to tell that there is no ſuch thing as Juſtification by any work, is to ſay that there is a Juſtification by a perſonal righteouſneſs, and there is not a Juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by a perſonal righteouſneſs, becauſe no Juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by any work; than which nothing can be more abſurd. But it may be ſaid there is no ſuch thing as Juſtification by a perſonal righteouſneſs of our own. I Anſwer, To tell of a perſonal righteouſneſs, and yet ſay it is not mine after any ſort, is as much as to ſay a perſonal righteouſneſs and not a perſonal righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs, which ſtill is a manifeſt contradiction, for how can I be perſonally righteous with a righteouſneſs that is not mine after ſome ſort? Yes, it may be it will be ſaid Chriſt's righteouſneſs whereby we are juſtified is our own by Imputation: If ſo, then God accounts it to be the righteouſneſs of your Perſons, or how can your Perſons be juſtified by it? And if God account it to be the righteouſneſs of your Perſons, then he muſt account you in your own Perſons to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed to ſome Law hereby, (or elſe how ſhould Juſtification, as all that call themſelves Proteſtants con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs, be a juridical or Law act) And can you be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed in your own Perſons to a Law without a work? We are, you may ſay, conformed to the Law in our own Perſons by the work and obedience of another; <hi>i. e.</hi> Chriſt, to that Law. This now is as much as to ſay, that you are conformed to the Law in your own Perſons, without any perſonal conformity, ſtill contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction. Well, but Chriſt's perſonal conformity to the Law is reckoned by God in our Juſtification to be our perſonal conformity; if ſo, then God muſt account you to be perfect fulfillers of the Law, and if God do this, he muſt account you alſo to be performers of the obedience that Law calls for, or he cannot account you
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:31257:30"/> fulfillers. After all this, now here is the miſtery, ſtill you will deny that you are juſtified by a Covenant of Works, or by any work accounted by God to be your own. Here is the Riddle, look who can unfold it; ſo that plain it is, ſome Perſons will not have Faith to be a juſtifying righteouſneſs, becauſe it is a work, and yet they themſelves according to their own notion muſt and do hold Juſtification by perfect legal works, which are excluded from Juſtification by the Holy Scripture, while it ſpeaks expreſly of Juſtificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on by Faith, as hath been ſhewn above.</p>
                     <p>Well, but we are not juſtified by any works ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectively in us, or done by us. I Anſwer, you ſay they are yours by Imputation, and if ſo, God muſt account them not only to be done by you, but to be ſubjectively in you, for if God do account me to have perſonally done this or the other (which he muſt do if he impute what Chriſt hath done to me, and ſo ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count his obedience to be my formal perſonal righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs) he muſt account me to be or to have been the ſubject of that work. <hi>Actiones ſunt ſuppoſitorum,</hi> but this I have cleared above.</p>
                     <p>But why will they not admit of Faith as juſtifying righteouſneſs becauſe it is a work? I ſuppoſe they think it would occaſion boaſting, now the Scripture ſpeaks far otherwiſe. The Holy Spirit in it ſaith, where all is received of free gift, there is no ground for boaſting, and ſure I am nothing is more expreſs than Faith to be freely given. And the Apoſtle is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs, that boaſting is excluded by the Law of Faith, or that Law which commands Faith in Chriſt, and if by the Law of Faith, then by Faith it ſelf where it is: for true Faith where it is, 'tis of that nature as to ſet the Crown wholly upon Chriſt's Head, and keep the Soul that hath it low and humble. But now as to the other Law; <hi>i. e.</hi> the Law of perfect ſinleſs works, ſuch works as have no Sin attends them, if we ſeek for Juſtification by a righteouſneſs which is a confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:31257:31"/> thereunto, here is a foundation for boaſting, and that becauſe if I be juſtified by it, I muſt merit and deſerve in my own Perſon Life by my conformity thereunto, and ſo the merit of another muſt be wholly excluded, this is that now which ſome Perſons do not take heed unto, when they ſay that Goſpel works ſuch as Faith in the matter of Juſtification, I mean the qualifying matter; lays a foundation for boaſting, they ſhould prove, before they can have ground for their Aſſertion; that Faith hath a purchaſing meritorious efficacy, but this they do not, nor cannot. For though <hi>Adam</hi> had what he had both of Moral and Natural integrity by the grace of Creation; yet had he continued to have yielded conformity to the Law of Innocency, he might have boaſted in this, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended upon it as a righteouſneſs which would have merited and deſerved the continuance of Life for him. Perſons may be high pretenders to exalt Chriſt and his righteouſneſs; but if they will have a righteouſneſs which is a conformity to the Law of Innocency to be their perſonal juſtifying righteouſneſs, they muſt have a perſonal meritorious righteouſneſs, and theſe muſt open a wide door for boaſting. But if Perſons will have Juſtification by Faith, as a perſonal Goſpel righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs to give them right, which is for this conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted by God for Chriſt's Merits, this wholly excludes all boaſting as to the having a perſonal righteouſneſs that is in it ſelf, or in its own nature ſatisfying and meriting, and thus Chriſt and the grace of God in him in a Sinner's Juſtification and Salvation is exalted. This Law of Faith is that which the Apoſtle oppoſeth to that Law he ſpeaks of in <hi>Philip.</hi> 3. 9. the righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs or obſervation of which <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>e diſclaims in point of Juſtification, or as that which gives any right to Chriſt, Pardon and Life. And therefore the righteouſneſs of this Law; <hi>i. e.</hi> the Law of Faith is called by the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle in this Verſe, the righteouſneſs which is through the Faith of Chriſt, and the righteouſneſs of God by
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:31257:31"/> Faith, this, this is the righteouſneſs which hath Chriſt for its Object, and is appointed by God in his Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of Grace to be our perſonal juſtifying righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. This was the righteouſneſs the Apoſtle would have that he might be found in him; <hi>i. e.</hi> united unto him. Very few of our Divines but they hold we are united to Chriſt by Faith, and this was that the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle valued above all union with him; ſeeing then the Apoſtle oppoſeth that which gives intereſt in Chriſt, and union with him unto his own righteouſneſs in this Verſe, that which gives intereſt then and unites muſt be Faith, and ſo he muſt be far from diſclaiming it as dung. Now if ſo Perſons will have the righteouſneſs of Chriſt meant by this righteouſneſs through Faith and by Faith, then it muſt be the righteouſneſs of Chriſt which unites to Chriſt, and ſo the ſame thingmuſt unite unto, and give intereſt in it ſelf; But whoever ſaid this?</p>
                     <p>But to proceed no further in this, let us hear what they have to ſay for the vindication of this ſtrict Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation of Chriſt's righteouſneſs.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. <hi>Chriſt's righteouſneſs</hi> (ſay they) <hi>muſt be our only perſonal juſtifying righteouſneſs, becauſe there will be no ſtanding in judgment before God, unleſs we be cloathed with a perfect righteouſneſs, and there is no ſuch righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, but that of Chriſt's.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>I Anſwer, if the proceſs in judgment ſhould be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the terms of the Law of Innocency; <hi>i. e.</hi> that Sentence muſt paſs upon Perſons according to conformity or non-conformity to this Law, then the reaſon would be cogent: But ſeeing it ſhall not there is no force in it at all. That it ſhall not, See <hi>Rom. 2. 16. In the day when God ſhall judge the ſecrets of Men by Chriſt Jeſus according to my Goſpel.</hi> 2 Theſ. 1. 7, 8. <hi>And to you who are troubled, reſt with us, when the Lord Jeſus ſhall be revealed from Heaven, with his mighty An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, in flaming fire, taking vengeance on them that know not God, and that obey not the Goſpel of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt:</hi> which Scriptures with others make it manifeſt,

Hence there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore as Perſons in judgment ſhall be found, ſuch as have been obedient or diſobedient to the Goſpel, ſo ſhall the Sentence paſs to Life or Condemnation, <hi>John</hi> 3. 36. <hi>He that believeth on the Son, hath everlaſting LIfe; and he that believeth not the Son, ſhall not ſee life: but the wrath of God abideth on him.</hi> Though know it ſhall be for the ſake of Chriſt's perfect righteouſneſs, that ſuch as are found true penitent Believers ſhall be adjudged to eternal Life at that day; ſeeing had it not been for this his meritorious righteouſneſs, there had been no Covenant of Grace, and ſo no accepting of any to Life upon ſuch terms as the Goſpel requires; ſo that the whole glory of Believers Salvation muſt redound to him, I ſpeak here of the Adult, unleſs Perſons have an intereſt in and a right unto a perfect righteouſneſs, and ſo unto the righteouſneſs of Chriſt, they ſhall not be cleared and adjudged to Life in judgment. But the Queſtion is, Whether all have an intereſt in, and a right unto his righteouſneſs? If not, Who are they that have? Will you ſay any, ſpeaking of the Adult, that live under the ſound of the Goſpel, but ſuch as are found obedient thereunto? And are not true peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent Believers the Perſons which are obedient? if ſo then, they are the Perſons who ſhall be cleared and adjudged to eternal Life in judgment. But it may be ſaid not for their Repentance and Faith. I Anſwer, ſtill not for theſe as the purchaſing meriting cauſes: but upon theſe as the qualifying matter of right, which <hi>qualifying matter of right,</hi> though it be not as is acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged a righteouſneſs anſwerable to the Law of Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency, and ſo can be no juſtifying righteouſneſs in the account of that Law, yet is a righteouſneſs agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the Goſpel; and ſo is a juſtifying righteouſneſs in the judgment of that Law.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. <hi>Chriſt's righteouſneſs, ſay they, muſt be our only per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal juſtifying righteouſneſs, becauſe all that are juſtified are juſtified by the righteouſneſs of another, and this other
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:31257:33"/> by whoſe righteouſneſs they muſt be juſtified can be none but Chriſts.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>I Anſwer, I do not deny but affirm that thoſe that are juſtified are juſtified by the righteouſneſs of another, and that by Chriſts, and his only as the purchaſe and merit of Juſtification: But then that this is the <hi>qualify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing righteouſneſs</hi> of mine or another's Perſon, which gives intereſt in Chriſt, and a right to Pardon and Life according to the Goſpel, this I deny. For though it be for Chriſt we are juſtified; yet it is by Faith in him as imputed by God we are formally juſtified and made righteous, which Faith though it be our own, and ſo our own righteouſneſs by free gift and poſſeſſion, yet is none of our own, but Chriſt's in point of Merit, and thus we are juſtified by a righteouſneſs Chriſt hath merited, and God's in point of Efficiency, as he by his Spirit is the Author of it. And there is this I would ask by the way; <hi>i. e.</hi> Whether Juſtification be not a Goſpel priviledge? if it be, as I hope it will not be denied, Then are not all Goſpel priviledges purchaſed and merited by Chriſt? if ſo, then certainly Juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion among the reſt. And if Juſtification, give me leave further to ask, Did Chriſt purchaſe and merit his own righteouſneſs? you grant he purchaſed and merit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the priviledge of Juſtification, and you ſay that Chriſt's righteouſneſs is the only formal juſtifying righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs of our Perſons; muſt you not then alſo ſay that he purchaſed and merited his own righteouſneſs, certainly, yes. Now pray! When, or how, or by what did Chriſt this? if you ſay that Chriſt did not pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe and merit his own righteouſneſs; then I ask, How did he purchaſe and merit Juſtification? And how is Juſtification then in your Senſe a Goſpel privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge purchaſed and merited by Chriſt? It may be you will ſay that Chriſt purchaſed and merited that his righteouſneſs might be imputed by God unto us for our Juſtification; grant this, ſtill you muſt ſay that he purchaſed and merited not that which you
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:31257:34"/> call the matter of your Juſtification, and ſo what you ſay muſt come to this that Chriſt did not merit and purchaſe that which juſtifies you, and if ſo, then that which juſtifies you muſt not be that which is purchaſed and merited by Chriſt. See then however in this, if the charge of <hi>Socinianiſm</hi> do not fall foul upon your ſelves, as to the material part of your Juſtification. Whereas the Scripture ſaith we are <hi>juſtified by his blood; i. e.</hi> his Blood muſt purchaſe and merit that which juſtifies, as well as God's Imputation of it; but will you ſay that Chriſt's Blood purchaſed and merited Chriſt's righteouſneſs, which you ſay is the very matter of Juſtification.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. <hi>Chriſt's righteouſneſs only, ſay they, muſt be our juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying righteouſneſs, becauſe Believers have union and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with him.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>This is no Argument; we grant that all true Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers have union and communion with Chriſt; but then it is affirmed generally this union is by Faith, and communion of his part not by the communication of his righteouſneſs, which is proper to himſelf as Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atour, but by the communication of his Grace the fruit of his purchaſe, by virtue of his righteouſneſs the merit hereof.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. <hi>Chriſt's righteouſneſs, ſay they, muſt be our only juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying righteouſneſs, becauſe this was the end of his fulfilling the Law.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>I Anſwer, if they ſpeak of Chriſt's Obedience to the Law of Innocency, I grant he yielded perfect confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity to that Law both in habit and act: But then that this was the end that his righteouſneſs ſhould be imputed unto us as our very formal perſonal righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs remains to be proved; for if they ſpeak of Chriſt's active Obedience here, it was an ingredient into the meritorious cauſe of our Redemption, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation, and Acceptation; <hi>Galat.</hi> 4. 4, 5. <hi>For when the fulneſs of the time was come, God ſent forth his Son, made of a Woman, made under the Law.

                        </gap>r Juſtification, to be Chriſts, and his only, or does he account it to be the righteouſneſs of another; if he account it to be his only, then how doth he account it to be your perſonal righteouſneſs? If he account it to be the perſonal righteouſneſs of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, ſuppoſe of a Believer, then how doth he account it to be Chriſts, and his only? That which is Chriſts, and his only cannot be mine in it ſelf, that which is mine and the very formal righteouſneſs of my Perſon cannot be Chriſts, and his only, becauſe God muſt account it to be mine as well as Chriſts. True in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, Grace is Chriſts, and his only both as the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſer, Lord Treaſurer, and the great mean of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyance; but then Chriſt's righteouſneſs which is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to him, is nor cannot be for communication to us as grace is, ſeeing it is for ſatisfaction, and ſo reſpects God immediately, and for merit and ſo the grace of Juſtification, Adoption, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> muſt be the bleſſed fruits hereof. We have upon Repentance and Faith, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation and Peace with God, for the ſatisfaction given to God; but we have not that which made ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction; we have likewiſe Juſtification, Pardon, and Life for his Merits, if true penitent Believers; but we have not that in it ſelf which merited this Grace. It is very ſtrange that Perſons ſhould ſo much as think that that which was the ſatisfaction and merit ſhould be given to them in it ſelf, and that God ſhould ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count them ſuch as ſatisfied God's Juſtice in Chriſt, and merited Pardon and Life in Chriſt. Theſe Men they condemn the Papiſts, for ſaying Chriſt merited
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:31257:35"/> that we might merit, and yet cannot nor will not ſee that they are holding the ſame themſelves in the ſtrict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Senſe. True it is, for Chriſt's ſatisfaction we have Peace, and for his Merits, we have Spirit and Grace: But then to tell of our ſatisfying in Chriſt, and merit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in Chriſt, as though we might have Peace for our ſatisfying in him, and Grace for our meriting in him, 'tis mighty groſs. I know here they will ſay, they hold no ſuch thing; I Anſwer, If <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>en will hold that they either do not, or will not underſtand, what, or who can help them? But it would do well if they would conſider that ſo long as they hold Chriſt and themſelves to be one legal Perſon, 'tis not poſſible what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever their practice be, they ſhould hold any leſs in the notion.</p>

                     <p>I Anſwer, That Chriſt did ſuſtain the Perſon of a Mediatour, for the making atonement, and purcha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing reconciliation; I grant, but that he ſuſtained the Perſon of all thoſe (as a ſinner) that ſhould after be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve in him; this I deny, ſeeing then he ſhould have been accounted the offending party, and ſo as ſuch had been incapable of purchaſing and making peace betwixt the offending and offended. For he that is accounted guilty, and ſo an offender ſhould have need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a Mediatour and reconciler for himſelf; but this Chriſt did not, therefore to tell of Chriſt's being a publick Perſon in this Senſe is falſe, and not only ſo, but deſtructive of his Office as Mediatour, and ſo alſo of his Satisfaction and Merit, as is manifeſt. And whereas it may be ſaid, How could he have ſuffered, if by the Law he was not accounted guilty, and an offender? I Anſwer, The Law did not account Chriſt as guilty, or an offender, nor did it ever condemn him; but on the contrary it accounted him a righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Perſon (not conſidering him at all as a Mediatour or Surety) and juſtified him as a fulfiller of it both in Nature and Life, and therefore he was under no ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation at all by the Law of Innocency to Suffer, but the obligation was from the Law of Redemption or Mediation, by his own free and voluntary ſuſception, according to the paction betwixt him and the Father. <hi>The juſt ſuffered for the unjuſt, that he might bring us to God.</hi> If juſt, then by what Law was he juſt? He that is juſt in Law, by that Law that accounts him juſt, as ſuch he cannot be accounted guilty or an

Hence therefore that which they would gather from Chriſt's being a publick Perſon muſt fall with its foundation, for neither the Law, nor God by the Law did account that Chriſt did ſo perſonate Sinners, as to reckon what he did and ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered, they did and ſuffered. What Chriſt did and ſuffered, it was accounted to be done and ſuffered <hi>for us,</hi> but not accounted to be done and ſuffered <hi>by us;</hi> for if ſo, then God ſhould accept ſatisfaction immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately from us, and not from Chriſt, and God muſt account us immediately to have merited, and not Chriſt; <hi>i. e.</hi> Chriſt ſhould only be accounted by God as the means whereby we ſatisfied his Juſtice, and merited Life for our ſelves; for if all that Chriſt did and ſuffered be by God reputed as done and ſuffered by us, then I ask for what end? for that which was done and ſuffered by Chriſt was ſatisfactory and meri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious; now if Chriſt obeyed and ſuffered for this end, that God might account what he did and ſuffered to be done and ſuffered by us, then Chriſt muſt have obeyed and ſuffered for this end, that God might have ſatisfaction from us, and that we by his means might merit a right to Life.

                     <p>I Anſwer, This Argument ſuppoſeth that Perſons may be formally perſonally righteous with a ſinleſs perfect righteouſneſs, for ſuch is Chriſt's, and ſo ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted by God, and ſo ſinleſs and perfectly righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous in their nature, as hath been ſhewn before, and yet for all this are and remain Sinners, which is a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction. Now I grant that all Men that are juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied are and do remain Sinners in the account of the Law of Innocency, but as juſtified they are accounted though not ſinleſs, yet righteous by the Law of Grace, being true penitent Believers, for Repentance and Faith, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are a Conformity to what it commands, upon which Conformity it aſſerts and maintains their intereſt in Chriſt, and right to Pardon and Life.

                     <p>I Anſwer, Similitudes illuſtrate, but they are no proof, neither do the things compared in all points bear an equal proportion; We grant then that Chriſt and true Believers are really, though miſtically united in a Marriage Covenant, and that as Believers they have forgiveneſs of Sin for the ſake of his meritorious and ſatisfactory righteouſneſs; and all that he hath done and ſuffered, and hereby purchaſed is for them in ſpecial, and their benefit; but then it doth not follow hereupon, that the Law of God violated by them doth account that they have fulfilled it in Chriſt, and ſuffered the penalty for their violation in him, for if ſo the Law ſhould adjudge them firſt to be perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly righteous, and then after that apply forgiveneſs un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them as Sinners, which is a manifeſt contradiction; for he that the Law doth account to be perfectly righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous (I ſpeak of the Law of Innocency) cannot be a Sinner, and if ſo muſt need no forgiveneſs. If it be ſaid the Law firſt acquits from guilt, and ſo forgives, this is no other but to make it a Covenant of Mercy and Life, and if it account a Perſon after the firſt for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveneſs perfectly righteous in Chriſt, then he muſt not after that be a Sinner, and ſo need no Pardon. Chriſt cannot in a ſound Senſe be ſaid to have taken
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:31257:38"/> our debts upon him any otherwiſe than he voluntarily and freely undertook to ſatisfie for our offences as Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatour, neither was he under obligation hereunto by any Law, but that of mediation. And further as to Believers having his righteouſneſs, this can be no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than it may be of uſe and benefit unto them; and the uſe and benefit Chriſt's righteouſneſs is of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Believers, What is it? ſure, 'tis for the ſatisfaction of an infinite God offended; and what doth God ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count it to be their perſonal righteouſneſs as to this uſe? If ſo, then God muſt account he hath ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on from them in their own Perſons. And as to its fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther uſe and benefit unto Believers; What is it? cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly, to merit all the good of Grace and Glory. And what now doth God account it to be their per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal righteouſneſs as to this uſe? If ſo, then God muſt account them to be righteous in their Perſons with ſuch a righteouſneſs as merits all the good of Grace and Glory. Now true it is Believers have Chriſt's righteouſneſs, or intereſt in it, or right unto it, as that for which God is reconciled unto them, and for which they ſhall have Grace and Glory, but they have it not ſo, nor are intereſted in it ſo as to be perſonally righteous with it, neither doth God account them ſo to have it. If they ſay God doth not account it the righteouſneſs of their Perſons, or that their Perſons are righteous with it, as it is ſatisfactory and meritorious, it cannot be the righteouſneſs of their Perſons under that formality. If they grant this, then I ſay they cannot have it all, ſo as to be perſonally righteous with it, for a righteouſneſs diveſted and ſtripped of ſatisfaction and merit can be none of Chriſt's, for it is eſſential to his righteouſneſs, as Mediatour to be ſatisfactory and meritorious; and if it be none of Chriſt's which is accounted by God to be their per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal righteouſneſs, or the righteouſneſs their Perſons are righteous withal for Juſtification; pray, What or whoſe can this righteouſneſs be which they ſay is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted

And have put on the new Man, which is renewed in know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, after the Image of him that created him.</hi> Epheſ. 4. 24. <hi>And that ye put on the new Man, which after God is created in righteouſneſs, and true holineſs.</hi> He had Light for his Underſtanding, Holy Love for his Will, Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs for his Life and Converſation.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Man being ſuch a Creature muſt be capable of Moral Government; <hi>i. e.</hi> of being ruled by Law; for that Creature which is capable of knowing, loving, and obeying God, muſt alſo be capable of being ruled by the Law of a Wiſe, Holy, and Righteous God.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. God therefore from the firſt put Man under a Law. To ſay that God did not, is to affirm. That the capacity which Man had of knowing, loving, and obeying God reſulting from his Moral perfections was in vain: but God gave Man nothing in vain. And it would be to affirm that God did not ſtand in rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to Man as his Rector and Governour, nor Man in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>elation to God as his Subject by right.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. God ever ſuited his legal Conſtitutions or Laws to the ſtate and condition of Man; in the ſtate of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegrity God ſuited that his ſtate with a Law requiring perſonal perfect Obedience. Man conſidered as fallen from that integrity into a ſtate of Sin and Miſery,
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:31257:41"/> God ſuited this his ſtate with a Law injoining ſincere Obedience, and this not only initial, or upon his firſt ſubjection, but continued, and conſtant to the end of his Life: the one for giving him right through Chriſt to Pardon and Life, the other for continuing that right.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. Both theſe Laws, <hi>i. e.</hi> that of Innocency and that of Grace, have their ſanction both premiant and penal; <hi>i. e.</hi> a promiſe of reward in caſe of Obedience, and the threatning of puniſhment in caſe of Diſobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. Theſe things being ſo, I put the Queſtion, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Innocent <hi>Adam</hi>'s Obedience to the firſt Law, would not have given him right unto the Life pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed? And whether this ſame Law of Innocency would not have maintained this his right? The firſt we muſt grant, or elſe ſay, that the promiſe gives no right to the benefits promiſed, though the condition be performed, which to ſay is againſt the rule of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon equity: we muſt grant the latter alſo, or elſe ſay that the very Inſtrument God hath appointed for the conveying of right to Life to Innocent <hi>Adam,</hi> ſhould not be regarded by him in point of claim for all <hi>Adam</hi>'s perfect Obedience, ſuppoſe his right ſhould have been called into Queſtion, which to ſay muſt needs be to charge God with unfaithfulneſs and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtice.</p>
                     <p>Now if ſo be (as is clear) <hi>Adam</hi>'s Obedience to the Law of Innocency would have given him right to the Life promiſed, and alſo maintained this his right; then will not our Obedience to the ſecond Law; <hi>i. e.</hi> to the Law of Grace give us right unto the reward promiſed, and ſecure us through Chriſt from the puniſhment threatned? And ſecondly, Will not this ſame Law of Grace alſo maintain our right? It muſt, or elſe we muſt ſay, that the promiſe gives no right unto the benefits promiſed, though the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition required be performed by the Grace of God,
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:31257:42"/> alſo that the very inſtrument God hath appointed for the conveying of right unto us ſhould by him not be regarded, or not be at all of any benefit unto us, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding our performance of the condition, if our right ſhould be called into queſtion.</p>
                     <p>To illuſtrate what I have ſaid, ſuppoſe that we ſhould have a deed of gift of ſuch an inheritance up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the due performance of ſuch or ſuch conditions therein expreſſed; Will not the performance of theſe conditions give us right according to the deed unto the inheritance? and if ſo be our right be called into queſtion, what muſt vindicate our right but the deed whereby it was given and granted unto us upon the performance of the conditions expreſſed. If then theſe things be ſo (as is evident) then I gather from hence that which I intended; <hi>i. e.</hi> that there muſt be ſuch a thing as Juſtification by conſtitution or Law, and ſeeing there can be no Juſtification by the Law of Innocency, or Covenant of Works; then there muſt be another Law which we muſt have Juſtification by, and what can this be but a Law of Grace and Mercy, which is the ſame with that we call the Goſpel; now if Perſons will not grant ſuch a Law, then Juſtificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on muſt either be by the Law of perfect Works; <hi>i. e.</hi> by the Covenant of Works, or that Juſtification we now have muſt be no Law act, and if ſo they who contend againſt us to deſtroy their own declared O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion, aſſerting that Juſtification is a juridical or Law term: thoſe therefore that deny the Goſpel to be a Law, they muſt either deny Juſtification by it, and ſo account we are juſtified by the Law of Works, or elſe they muſt contradict themſelves in affirming Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication not to be by Law.</p>
                     <p>But becauſe ſome Perſons do not only deny but ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicule ſuch a thing as a Law of Grace, calling it an humane invention; it will not be amiſs a little to clear this that there is a Law of Grace diſtinct from that of Works.</p>
                     <pb n="63" facs="tcp:31257:42"/>
                     <p>Obſerve then, I hope thoſe that oppoſe us will grant that God required of Man while in the ſtate of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegrity a ſinleſs Obedience; Now the Queſtion will be, ſeeing Man is a fallen Creature, whether God doth require any Obedience of him? If not, then Man muſt be at his own will to do what he liſteth; and is he ſo? If God doth require Obedience, what is it? Is it ſinleſs Obedience? If ſo, then all Mankind muſt be loſt, for none of the fallen race of <hi>Adam</hi> can per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form it. If they ſay that Obedience is performed by Chriſt for us. I ask, Hath Chriſt performed this Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience that we might be exempted and obey none at all? If ſo, then he obeyed to ſet us free from all ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection to God, if not, then it remains, for all Chriſt perfectly obeyed that, yet ſtill we are under obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to obey in our own Perſons. Seeing then we cannot yield ſinleſs Obedience, or Obedience without Sin attending it; Are not we through the aſſiſting Grace of God to perform ſincere Obedience? If not, then none at all; if we are, then it will either be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted of God, or it will not: If it will not, Then to what purpoſe is it performed? If it will, Then is it of Grace that God accepts it. And if of Grace, muſt it not be accepted in and through Chriſt's Satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factory and Meritorious Righteouſneſs? If ſo, then it muſt be revealed by God in his word to be his will that we ſhould thus obey; <hi>i. e.</hi> ſincerely, and that we ſhall be accepted through Chriſt hereupon: this will of God commanding is either a Law or it is not? If not, then there is no Tranſgreſſion if we do not obey; if it be, then they muſt grant us a Law of Grace which for the ſake of Chriſt will accept of ſincere obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience inſtead of perfect; and alſo they muſt grant that Chriſt hath purchaſed this, or elſe they and all Mankind (upon a ſuppoſition that God had continued Man) ſhould ſtill have been obliged to ſinleſs obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

<pb n="64" facs="tcp:31257:43"/> been left to the execution of the Curſe, and been damned for ever. And obſerve this Law of Grace of which we ſpeak doth not deſtroy the Moral Law ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marily contained in the Ten Commands, for we ſay ſtill we are under obligation to have reſpect unto, and obey all its commands in avoiding Sins which are for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden, and performing the duties which are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded therein. But this is that, we ſay that we cannot nor do not perfectly obey, though we have a principle of Grace wrought in us by the Holy Spirit; but yet we ſincerely obey, and have reſpect unto its commands, this ſhall be pleaſing and acceptable to God for the ſake of our bleſſed Mediatour. And ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſuch obedience would not have been accepted of God (upon a ſuppoſition that fallen Man could have performed it of himſelf, which I am ſure he could not) had not the Lord Jeſus Chriſt by his Satisfaction and Merit procured it ſhould; is not here a plain dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent conſtitution, and ſo a new Law purchaſed by Chriſt diſtinct from that which <hi>Adam</hi> in the ſtate of Innocency was under.</p>
                     <p>But upon the matter ſome ſay the obedience injoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Adam,</hi> and the obedience commanded us now is the ſame ſpecifically or in its own nature, and differs only gradually, and therefore the Law muſt be the ſame, and there is no neceſſity of a new one; I An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, grant we that the obedience doth only differ gradually conſidered <hi>materially,</hi> yet the obedience in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joined us <hi>formally</hi> differs from that of Innocent <hi>Adam</hi>'s, and therefore cannot be of the ſame nature with his, for our obedience is to be performed by us as penitent Subjects, not ſo innocent <hi>Adam</hi>'s, and alſo in Faith of acceptation through a Redeemer and Mediatour, but not ſo innocent <hi>Adam</hi>'s, ſo that our obedience now formally differs from that of <hi>Adam</hi>'s in Innocency, and therefore differs from it <hi>ſpecifically,</hi> and not only <hi>gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dually,</hi> and hence there muſt be a new conſtitution or Law injoining it, Or elſe what warrant have we for
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:31257:43"/> it? But ſuppoſe there ſhould be only a gradual dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference, when indeed there is more as is manifeſt, yet it doth not follow that the Law commanding is the ſame; for it is ſinleſs obedience the Law of Innocency requires, and it will accept of no leſs; now if leſs be accepted we muſt have a new Revelation, and ſo a new warrant for it from a command, or elſe what foundation for it, or incouragement unto it, and ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing we have a new Revelation, and ſo a new warrant from God's command of this obedience, then we muſt have a Law to which it relates diſtinct from that given to Innocent Man; but in the very matter of obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, we ſhall find that injoined us, which was not commanded <hi>Adam</hi> in the Law of Innocency, nor in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed did ſuit at all with the nature of ſuch a Law; which will make it further evident we muſt have a new Law as fallen Creatures diſtinct from that. <hi>Iſa. 1. 16, 17, 18. Waſh ye, make you clean: put away the evil of your doings from before mine eyes, ceaſe to do evil, Learn to do well, ſeek judgment, relieve the oppreſſed, judge the fatherleſs, plead for the widow. Come now, and let us reaſon together, ſaith the Lord: though your ſins be as ſcarlet, they ſhall be as white as ſnow: though they be red like crimſon, they ſhall be as wooll.</hi> Iſa. 55. 7. <hi>Let the wicked forſake his way, and the unrighteous Man his thoughts: and let him return unto the Lord, and he will have mercy upon him; and to our God, for he will abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly pardon.</hi> Ezech. 18. 21, 22. <hi>But if the wicked will turn from all his ſins that he hath committed, and keep all my ſtatutes, and do that which is lawful and right, he ſhall ſurely live, he ſhall not die. All his tranſgreſſions that he hath committed, they ſhall not be mentioned unto him: in his righteouſneſs that he hath done, he ſhall live.</hi> Acts 3. 19. <hi>Repent ye therefore, and be converted, that your ſins may be blotted out, when the times of refreſhing ſhall come from the preſence of the Lord,</hi> &amp;c. What is required in theſe Texts, is the revealed will of God which Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners through his Grace are to be ſubject unto; And
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:31257:44"/> is not ſubjection where it is yielded obedience? Can this will of God then thus commanding be any other than a Law, ſeeing that non-performance muſt be a manifeſt tranſgreſſion and diſobedience?? Let it be conſidered then if what we find commanded in theſe Texts, was injoyned <hi>Adam</hi> before his fall; had he needed to waſh him and make him clean, and put away the evil of his doings? was he then wicked, and called upon to forſake his wicked ways and ſinful thoughts, and turn unto the Lord, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he was guilty of any tranſgreſſion, was he called upon before his fall to repent and be converted that his Sins might be blotted out, before he had any Sin? and to believe in a Redeemer that he might be ſaved? or are theſe the commands of the Law requiring ſinleſs works? One would think thoſe that oppoſe us ſhould not affirm it and if not, is not all this required of Sinners? and muſt not that be a diſtinct Law by which it is required? and is not God's own conſtitution? how dare ſome Men then call it an humane invention? <hi>It ſhall come to paſs in the last days that the Mountain of the Lord's houſe ſhall be eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and many People ſhall go and ſup, come ye, and let us go up to the houſe of God, and he will mark us his ways, and we will walk in his paths; for out of Zion ſhall go forth the Law, and the word of the Law from Jeruſalem.</hi>

                     <head>SECT. VI. Juſtification deſcribed, and made good, partly in this, and partly in the Sections enſuing.</head>
                     <p>HAving proved that there is a Law of Grace di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct from that which requires ſinleſs works, and that God juſtifies by this Law, you may take this definition or deſcription: of Juſtification; <hi>i. e.</hi> Juſtification is God's aſſerting and maintaining act by his Law of Grace of our right to Pardon and Life for the ſake of Chriſt upon our believing.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. It is an act, and that <hi>ad extra,</hi> an act which makes a relative change, and the ſubject upon whom this relative change is made is Man, a guilty and condemned Sinner, one upon whom the ſentence of condemnation is paſſed by the Law, and he under obligation thereby to ſuffer eternal puniſhment, this is Man's condition antecedent to God's act of juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying, <hi>Rom. 3. 19. Now we know that what things ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever the Law ſaith, it ſaith to them who are under the Law; that every mouth may be ſtopped, and all the World may become guilty before God.</hi> Galat. 3. 22. <hi>But the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture hath concluded all under ſin, that the promiſe by Faith of Jeſus Chriſt might be given to them that believe.</hi> John 3. 18. <hi>He that believeth on him, is not condemned: but he that believeth not, is condemned already, becauſe he hath not believed in the name of the only begotten Son of God.</hi> Epheſ. 2. 3. <hi>Among whom, alſo we all had our conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation in times paſt, in the luſts of our fleſh, fulfilling the deſires of the fleſh, and of the mind, and were by nature the Children of wrath, even as others.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="2">2. In this act of juſtifying there is the term from which, or the ſtate from which Man a Sinner is brought upon his Juſtification, and that is from an obligation to puniſhment, and the omiſſion or loſs of right to Life and Happineſs. Every poor Soul before
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:31257:45"/> Faith is under an obligation to Eternal Puniſhment, and muſt loſe Heaven and Eternal Happineſs if he leave the World in this condition. How much then ſhould it be our concern to ſee that we have true Faith, that we have thankfully accepted of, and are ſincerely ſubject unto Chriſt, that ſo we may have through him a right to Pardon and Life. <hi>John 5. 24. Verily, verily I ſay unto you, He that heareth my word, and believeth on him that ſent me, hath everlaſting life, and ſhall not come into condemnation: but is paſſed from death unto life.</hi> Rom. 8. 1. <hi>There is therefore now no condemnation to them which are in Christ Jeſus, who walk not after the Fleſh, but after Spirit.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="3">3. In juſtifying there is the term to which or the ſtate a poor Sinner is brought into, and that is a right to this Pardon and Life ſpoken of before. No ſooner is a Sinner juſtified, but Pardon and Life are his; they are by Goſpel or Covenant right his. <hi>John 3. 16. For God ſo loved the World, that he gave his only begotten Son: that whoſoever believeth in him, ſhould not periſh, but have everlaſting life;</hi> and Verſe 36. <hi>He that believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth on the Son, hath everlaſting life: and he that believeth not the Son, ſhall not ſee life: but the wrath of God abideth on him.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="4">4. There is the agent or he that juſtifies, and that is God, we are before Repentance and Faith guilty and condemned, and until God do juſtifie us we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main in that guilty and condemned ſtate; therefore if ever we have a right to Pardon and Life God gives it, <hi>Rom. 3. 26. To declare, I ſay, at this time his righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs: that he might be just, and the juſtifier of him which believeth in Jeſus.</hi> Rom 4. 5. <hi>But to him that worketh not, but believeth on him that juſtifieth the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly: his faith is counted for righteouſneſs.</hi> Rom. 8. 30. 33. <hi>Moreover, whom he did predeſtinate, them he alſo called and whom he called, them he alſo juſtified: and whom he juſtified, them he alſo glorified. Who ſhall lay any thing to the charge of God's elect? it is God that juſtifieth.</hi> 1. Hence
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:31257:45"/> learn firſt, how much we ſhould adore and admire the riches of mercy in Chriſt, that after we had great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly offended him, and expoſed our ſelves to his wrath and diſpleaſure everlaſtingly; having involved our ſelves in a ſtate of guilt and condemnation, having forfeited all right to Life; I ſay, that after this, all this, yet he ſhould be willing to become our juſtifier the forgiver of our Sins, and the Donor of a right to Happineſs, and this upon honourable terms with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation to himſelf, and reaſonable with reſpect to us; How much doth this call for our Admiration and Ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, certainly it will be the work of Heaven. 2. How great folly are poor impenitent Sinners guilty of, for though God be willing to juſtifie, ready to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, and receive into his favour, and make over unto them a ſure title to Erernal Life, if they will but now humbly come in upon his call, and thankfully accept his Son to be their Propitiation, Head, and Teacher, and be ſubject to him in Chriſt; yet they refuſe, they hold faſt deceit, and will not return; they ſet no value upon this great good offered, they prefer their Soul damning Luſts, and the Profits and Pleaſures of a vain tranſitory World, they content themſelves to live unforgiven, at enmity to God, Heirs of Hell, deſtitute of right to Life and Salvation. O what folly How much is the condition of ſuch to be lamented, who chuſe death before Life, guilt before Pardon, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecution in Hell before the fruition of a glorious reſt in Heaven. God calls them to incline their ear and come unto him, hear, and their Souls ſhall live, and he will make an everlaſting Covenant with them, even the ſure mercies of <hi>David, Iſa.</hi> 55. 3. he aſſures them by his promiſe that if they will forſake their wicked ways, and ſinful thoughts, he will have mercy, and abundantly pardon; <hi>Verſe</hi> 7, but alas! all this moves them not, they are ſtill as unconcerned as before. 3. That Juſtification is not from Eternity. For any to affirm this is to affirm a contradiction; <hi>i. e.</hi> that we
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:31257:46"/> were both guilty, condemned, and juſtified from Eternity; for who now are juſtified but ſuch as before were guilty and condemned: ſo that firſt God con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demns us from Eternity as guilty, and then juſtifies us from Eternity according to theſe Men; touching what they alledge; <hi>i. e.</hi> God's purpoſe and decree, they may as groundedly gather from it that Perſons are effectually called from Eternity, conformed to the Image of Chriſt, and glorified from Eternity.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. In the deſcription, I ſay, it is God's act by his Law of Grace, it is not by an immediate, but a me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate act that God juſtifies, ſeeing it is God's act by this his Law; and that it is will appear further, if we conſider that we can neither be juſtified by the Law of innocent Nature, nor by the Law of <hi>Moſes.</hi> And if not, then by ſome other Law, for as condemnation is by Law, ſo Juſtification. As diſobedience then to the Law of Grace brings upon us condemnation; ſo obedience to the ſame Law gives right to Pardon and Life which is Juſtification: If ſo be that Sinners re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main impenitent unbelieving Rebels againſt Chriſt, by this Law they are condemned; but on the contrary, if they through Grace become Penitent, Obedient Believers, then this Law intitles them to impunity and Life. <hi>Prov. 17. 15. He that juſtifieth the wicked, and be that condemneth the just, even they both are an abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation to the Lord.</hi> Now then if both theſe be an abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination to the Lord; he can neither do the one, nor the other; <hi>i. e.</hi> he will neither juſtifie the wicked, nor condemn the juſt; but on the contrary he will juſtifie the juſt. The Judge of all the Earth will do right. <hi>Gen.</hi> 18. 25. He will undoubtedly act according to his Preſcription. <hi>Deut.</hi> 25. 1. The Judges were to juſtifie the righteous, and condemn the wicked; ſo then, as a Man muſt be wicked before God condemn him; and juſt before God juſtifie him; then he that is wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed muſt be ſo accounted from his diſobedience to ſome Law; to ſay a Man is wicked, and yet he is not diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedient
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:31257:46"/> to ſome Law, is to ſay there is no tranſgreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion where there is no Law; and ſeeing thoſe are only wicked who go on in the practice of Sin unrepented of, and will not believe, nor give their conſent to be ſubject to God in Chriſt, then ſuch muſt be accounted wicked from their rebellion and diſobedience to the Law of Grace, ſeeing it is this Law only that requires Repentance towards God, and Faith in our Lord Jeſus Chriſt: But then on the contrary a Man muſt be accounted juſt alſo by his Conformity to ſome Law; to ſay a Man is juſt and righteous, and ſay he is not in Heart and Life conformed to ſome Law, is to frame a righteouſneſs without relation to a Rule, which cannot be. Now ſeeing thoſe are righteous who are penitent Sinners, obedient Believers; they muſt be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted ſuch by the Law of Grace, ſeeing this is the righteouſneſs which it doth require; and whoever they are that have this righteouſneſs the Law of Grace will for the ſake of Chriſt juſtifie them hereupon; <hi>i. e.</hi> they have a right hereupon to Impunity and Life, both which are promiſed by the Covenant of Grace to all Penitent and believing Sinners. And further both Juſtification and Condemnation are accounted to be acts of a Judge, and a Judge he both juſtifies and condemns according to Law; ſo that in Law a Perſon is either juſtified or condemned before the Judge by publick Sentence do juſtifie or condemn. Thus then, as God hath conſtituted a Law, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to which he will both juſtifie and condemn, it is manifeſt that this Law of God, which is his Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, doth it ſelf condemn or juſtifie before God's publick Sentence as Judge either of Condemnation or Juſtification; hence it is ordinary for Perſons to ſay, they think ſuch an one is guilty in Law, or clear in Law before they come upon their Trial before the Judge, or he pronounce them either clear or guilty. Seeing then that, Chriſt is the great Legiſlator, Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giver, and Judge; <hi>Iſa. 33. 22. For the Lord is our Judge,

In the day when God ſhall judge the ſecrets of Men by Jeſus Christ, according to my Goſpel.</hi> As the Goſpel or Law of Grace is the Inſtrument whereby Chriſt doth juſtifie or condemn Sinners now; ſo it is the Rule according to which he as the righteous Judge will paſs Sentence at the great day to everlaſting Happineſs or eternal Damnation. To illuſtrate the matter, ſuppoſe a Perſon hath committed a capital Crime, <hi>i. e.</hi> a Crime for which he is to die, the King draws up, and ſends unto him a conditional Act of Grace, in which he offers Pardon; and not only ſo but his favour and great advancement, in caſe he will perform ſuch or ſuch conditions expreſſed in that Act; if the Criminal conſent, he is pardoned <hi>ipſo facto,</hi> im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately by virtue of the Act, and alſo hath right unto the favour and advancement promiſed, and this before the Judges acquitment according to the Act, and this right thus to be acquitted did reſult from his conſent: this is juſt the caſe with us, we all deſerve Death, and that Eternal; now the great King of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven as it were hath drawn up and ſent unto us a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditional Grant or Act of Grace, in which he offers Pardon, and not only ſo, but his favour, and the greateſt advancement, in caſe he will perform thoſe conditions, offering us his Grace that we may, now if we perform, then we immediately for Chriſt's ſake have right to his favour, and this high advancement, before the Judges publick Sentence.</p>
                     <pb n="73" facs="tcp:31257:47"/>
                     <p>Seeing further that there is the Preceptive and Retri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butive part of the Law of Grace; <hi>i. e.</hi> that part which commands duty, and that part in which God doth di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtribute rewards or puniſhments: The Queſtion will be what part it is whereby God doth juſtifie? I An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, The command it ſelf when obeyed, doth im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicitely juſtifie, ſincere obedience to the commands of the Goſpel implies our right, in that we cannot hereupon but beactually juſtified: But then directly and actually I take it to be the Goſpel promiſe which doth juſtifie; for obedience to the command which is the performance of the condition, hath reſulting from it a right to the promiſe both of Pardon and everlaſting Life, and it is by the promiſe that God doth aſſert us to have this right, which is his juſtifying of us, and will maintain this our right if called into queſtion. A little for the proof of this, <hi>He that confeſſeth and forſakes, ſhall find mercy,</hi> confeſſing and forſaking of Sin is that which God commands, now this being obeved; <hi>i. e.</hi> if there be an unfeigned confeſſing and forſaking of Sin; then ſaving mercy is by God through Chriſt conveyed in the promiſe, and this ſame pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe aſſerts, and vindicates in this conveyance the Souls right, which is its juſtifying act. That alſo, <hi>Let the wicked forſake his way, and the unrighteous Man his thoughts, and turn unto the Lord, and he will have mercy upon him, and to our God, and he will abundantly pardon;</hi> Now upon the wickeds forſaking his ways, and the unrighteous Man his thoughts, the promiſe annexed makes over his right (which conſiſts in his obedience to the preceding command) to the Pardon and Mercy promiſed; and will maintain and vindicate this his right in caſe it be called into queſtion. Now thoſe Perſons that will not admit of a Juſtification of this ſort, they will urge (that if we be Penitent returners) to flee to the Promiſe, and plead the promiſe, and will tell us that we have right unto the good promiſed, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſmuch as God by his Spirit hath wrought the quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fications
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:31257:48"/> which gives right, and if we muſt flee to the Promiſe and plead the Promiſe, as having a right through Chriſt upon ſuch qualifications which are of Grace; Doth not this ſpeak that the Promiſe doth both aſſert our right, and alſo will maintain our right to Pardon and Life? And what is it but juſtifying? Saith a Reverend Divine, you ſhall hear a Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant in his Prayer appealing from the Tribunal of God's Juſtice, to the Throne of his Grace, and yet in his Sermon be telling the People, that it is nothing elſe but the perfect Obedience and Satisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Chriſt imputed to them (you muſt know, to be accounted by God as their perſonal righteouſneſs) that ſaves them; which is to bring them back from the Throne of his Grace, to the Bar of his Juſtice to be judged.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. When I ſay that Juſtification is God's aſſerting act by his Promiſe of Grace our right to Pardon and Life for the ſake of Chriſt upon our believing, I do not think that Pardon is any part conſtituting our Juſtification, but a benefit which doth immediately follow thereupon. For conſider we Juſtification firſt, Actively, ſo it conſiſts in God's giving us a right through Chriſt by his Promiſe upon our obedience to the preceptive part of the Law of Grace; or if you will, upon our performance through his Grace of the conditions of the new Covenant, I mean ſuch upon which we have a right at the firſt, or at the firſt an intereſt, or our firſt acceptance into favour through Chriſt, <hi>Epheſ. 1. 6. To the praiſe of the glory of his grace, wherein he hath made us accepted in the beloved.</hi> Or <hi>2ly,</hi> Conſider we Juſtification paſſively, ſo it is our having this right. Now obſerve, Pardon is that which God gives right to by his promiſe, and which we have right to, conſidered as ſubjects qualified; <hi>i. e.</hi> as true penitent Believers, and ſo muſt be a precious benefit devolved upon us as Perſons who have right. But ſeeing that many worthy Divines have affirmed, and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:31257:48"/> taken to prove that our very juſtifying righteouſneſs conſiſts in Pardon of Sin, I ſhall here give my thoughts and the grounds of them upon the point, and ſhall not impoſe upon any, but leave Perſons to take or leave as they ſhall have light and evidence.</p>

                     <head>SECT. VII. Wherein Pardon and Juſtification agree, and wherein they diſagree.</head>
                     <p>I Shall then firſt ſhew wherein Juſtification and Pardon agree.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. They agree in the principal Efficient, which is God, 'tis God that Juſtifies, and 'tis God that Pardons. <hi>Rom. 8. 33. Who ſhall lay any thing to the charge of God's elect? it is God that juſtifieth.</hi> Epheſ. 4. 32. <hi>And be ye kind to one another, tender hearted, forgiving one another, even as God for Christ's ſake hath forgiven you.</hi> 1 John 1. 9. <hi>If we confeſs our ſins, he is faithful and juſt to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give us our ſins, and to cleanſe us from all unrighte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="2">2. They agree in the Meritorious Cauſe, Chriſt hath purchaſed the one and the other, it is for his Merits we are Juſtified, and for his Merits we are Pardoned. <hi>Rom. 3. 24. Being juſtified freely by his grace, through the redemption that is in Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> Rom. 5. 9. <hi>Much more then, being now juſtified by his blood, we ſhall be ſaved from wrath through him.</hi> Matth. 26. 28. <hi>For this is my blood of the New Teſtament, which is ſhed for many, for the remiſſion of ſins.</hi> Acts 13. 38. <hi>Be it known unto you therefore, Men and Brethren, that through this Man is preached unto you the forgiveneſs of ſins.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="3">3. They agree in the Subject, both Juſtification and Forgiveneſs relates to a Penitent Believer, and ſuch an one only (I ſpeak of the Adult) that is Juſtified, and
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:31257:49"/>
'tis a Penitent Believer, and ſuch an one that is Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned. <hi>Acts 10. 43. To him give all the Prophets wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, that through his Name whoſoever believeth in him ſhall receive remiſſion of ſins.</hi> Acts 3. 19. <hi>Repent ye there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, and be converted, that your ſins may be blotted out, when the times of refreſhing ſhall come from the preſence of the Lord.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="4">4. They agree in the Inſtrumental Cauſe, and that is the Covenant of Grace, or God's gracious Promiſe, for this is God's Inſtrument whereby he doth convey a right to Pardon, not only Pardon, but a right unto it. <hi>Iſa. 43. 25. I, even I am he, that blotteth out thy tranſgreſſions for mine own ſake, and will not remember thy ſins.</hi> Iſa. 44. 22. <hi>I have blotted out, as a thick cloud, thy tranſgreſſions, and as a cloud, thy ſins return unto me, for I have redeemed thee.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="5">5. They agree in time, when a Perſon is Juſtified, he is Pardoned, there is no time wherein a Perſon is Juſtified, but he is Pardoned, nor wherein he is Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned, but he is Juſtified.</p>
                     <p>I proceed Secondly, To ſhew wherein they dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. And Firſt, They differ as Juſtification hath the priority of Nature; <hi>i. e.</hi> Juſtification is in order of Nature before Pardon, a Man muſt in order of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture have a right to Pardon before he have it, he muſt Repent and Believe, and ſo be conformed to the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel Law, before he be righteous in the Senſe of that Law, and ſo have right to Pardon.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. They differ in their habitude or relation, Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication properly relates to a falſe Accuſation, Pardon of Sin to a true and juſt one, he that is accuſed falſly (when his Innocency is cleared as to the Crime of which he is accuſed) may be ſaid to be juſtified. <hi>Deut. 25. 1. If there be a controverſie between Men, and they, come unto judgment, that the judges may judge them, then they ſhall juſtifie the righteous, and condemn the wicked.</hi> But now he that is truly and juſtly accuſed, he may have
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:31257:49"/> Pardon of the Crime committed, but he cannot by that Law whereby he was Convict be juſtified, or ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted as righteous, with reſpect to the Crime of which he hath been truly and juſtly accuſed. He that is accuſed of Impenitency and Unbelief, if the Accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation be falſe, the Law of Grace accounts him righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous, and ſo juſtifies him againſt that Accuſation; But if a Perſon accuſed of Impenitency and Unbelief, and the Accuſation be true and juſt, this Law will Pardon upon Repentance and Faith through Chriſt, but it will not juſtifie upon Repentance and Faith, as a Perſon that hath been falſly accuſed, for he was truly and juſtly accuſed before he did Repent and Believe, though not when he believed.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. They differ in their Eſſence or Nature, that which conſtitutes Juſtification is our Conformity to the Law of Grace, upon which God in his gracious Promiſe through Chriſt accounts us righteous, but that which conſtitutes Pardon is not a Conformity or Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience of this ſort; but our acquittance and diſcharge from obligation to Puniſhment due, true it is upon this Goſpel Righteouſneſs for Chriſt's Satisfaction and Merits we are pardoned, but yet Pardon is not nor cannot be that Righteouſneſs which the Goſpel calls for to our Juſtification; for if ſo, we ſhould firſt have forgiveneſs, and then forgiveneſs upon the account of that forgiveneſs, and ſo Pardon of Sin ſhould be a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of it ſelf, and be in order of Nature before it ſelf, which I know not how to free from a contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. They differ in the different formality of the Subject to which they do relate, for the Law of Grace in juſtifying conſiders Perſons as conformed to its commands, and upon that accounts them through and for Chriſt righteous; but in pardoning it conſiders them previouſly as tranſgreſſors, though yet as thoſe who have right to Pardon by reaſon of their Conformity through Grace unto its Precepts; and therefore for
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:31257:50"/> Chriſt's ſake aſſures them of Pardon hereupon, for upon Confeſſion and forſaking of Sin, and turning unto the Lord, God by his gracious Promiſe aſſures us of Pardon. And that the Goſpel Law in pardoning doth previouſly conſider the Perſon as a tranſgreſſor, appears, for aſmuch as it Pardons not only ſuch as have right to Pardon, but thoſe who have need of it, and who have need but ſuch as before Pardon are altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in a ſpecial ſort unpardoned tranſgreſſors.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. There is a difference betwixt Juſtification and Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, as touching the Moral Efficiency of the Law of Grace juſtifying and pardoning; for in the one it aſſerts a Perſon's right, but in the other it conveys that which it aſſerted his right unto. Theſe things be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing laid together, and duly conſidered, to me 'tis evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent that Juſtification and Pardon cannot be the ſame, nor yet that Pardon can be our juſtifying Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, but a ſpecial benefit immediately following our Juſtification.</p>
                     <p>But it may be ſaid Condemnation and Juſtification are oppoſed, and therefore as Condemnation conſiſts in the Laws Sentence of a Sinner to puniſhment: ſo Juſtification muſt conſiſt in acquitting the Sinner by Law Sentence from puniſhment; and if ſo, Is not here Pardon? and if Pardon, Then muſt not Juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication conſiſt in Pardon?</p>
                     <p n="1">1. I Anſwer; Firſt, Juſtification and Condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion are oppoſed materially, for as the matter of Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication muſt be a Righteouſneſs: ſo the merit of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation muſt be Unrighteouſneſs; or thus, the matter of Juſtification muſt be Conformity to a Law: the merit of Condemnation muſt be the violation of that Law.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. They are oppoſed in the different account of the Law, for whom the Law Condemns, them it accounts. Guilty: But whom it Juſtifies, thoſe it accounts Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous. But now though Juſtification and Condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion be thus oppoſed, yet it doth not follow that
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:31257:50"/> what is the form of the one, the contrary to that is the form of the other; or it doth not follow that as Condemnation conſiſts in bearing the Laws Sentence to Puniſhment, ſo Juſtification in acquitting from Pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſhment. (Indeed all juſtified Perſons are moſt cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly acquitted, but Juſtification in its own nature is not an acquitment). Pardon and Condemnation are thus formally oppoſed, but not Juſtification and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation. But it may be ſaid further, muſt he not be innocent, who is acquitted? and is not every in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent Perſon righteous? I Anſwer, an acquitment implies the Perſon who is now acquitted was once guilty of that from which he is now acquitted; and ſo by Innocent, here can only be meant one that is diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged from deſerved puniſhment, and ſuch an one is clear indeed, but then this his clearing doth imply a right by ſome pardoning act, or act of Grace. Every juſtified perſon is diſcharged from the Condemnation of the Law, or the Execution of the Law's Sentence, but then this diſcharge implies a previous Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, not for which, but upon which he is accounted to have right to that diſcharge, and without which he might not have it, for he that believes not is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned, and the wrath of God abides upon him, ſo then a Perſon is righteous formally by this previous Righteouſneſs, and not by his diſcharge, for that is only, as is plain, the immediate fruit of his Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs.</p>

                     <head>SECT. VIII. How our right to Pardon and Life is through Chriſt, and how he is our Surety, and hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured the New Covenant for us.</head>
                     <p>I Come now to ſhew that it is through Chriſt that Sinners have right to Pardon and Life upon be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving; and it is through Chriſt in a double regard. In regard to a Ranſom paid, and Covenant ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained.</p>
                     <p>It is through Chriſt in the firſt place, as having paid the Ranſom for Sinners Redemption. <hi>Matth. 20. 28. Even as the Son of Man came not to be miniſtred unto, but to miniſter, and to give his life a ranſom for many.</hi> 1 Tim. 2. 5, 6. <hi>For there is one God, and one Mediatour between God and Men, the Man Christ Jeſus. Who gave himſelf a ranſom for all, to be teſtified in due time.</hi> We are all by Nature Sin's Slaves, Satan's Captives, loving the World, and the things of the World, curſed and condemned by the Law, being Tranſgreſſors, liable to the intollerable wrath of an Almighty God; Chriſt paid a ſufficient Ranſom by his Obedience and Sufferings, From the power and dominion of Sin. <hi>Titus 2. 14. Who gave himſelf for us, that he might re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deem us from all iniquity, and purifie unto himſelf a pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar People, zealous of good works.</hi> From the thraldom of Satan. <hi>Coloſſ. 2. 15. And having ſpoiled principalities and powers, he made a ſhew of them, openly triumphing over them in it.</hi> Heb. 2. 14. <hi>Foraſmuch then as the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren are partakers of fleſh and blood, he alſo himſelf likewiſe took part of the ſame, that through death he might deſtroy him that had the power of death; that is, the Devil.</hi> From this preſent evil World. <hi>Galat. 1. 4. Who gave himſelf for our ſins, that he might deliver us from this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent evil world, according to the will of God and our Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</hi>
                        <pb n="81" facs="tcp:31257:51"/> From the Curſe of the violated Law. <hi>Galat. 3. 13. Christ hath redeemed us from the curſe of the Law, being made a curſe for us: for it is written, Curſed is every one that hangeth on a tree.</hi> From the wrath of an offend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed God. This ranſom paid by Chriſt gave ſuch ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction to an offended God as that he deals with none of the Sons and Daughters of Men, now upon terms of the violated Law of works: but is ſo far through this ſatisfaction given reconciled, as that he grants them a reprieve from Hell, and much riches of goodneſs and mercy to lead them to repentance; yea, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veals himſelf further willing in a ſaving manner to be at peace with, and reconciled unto Sinners, upon their ſubjection to the Goſpel Law, who have the explicit offer. And this ſatisfaction given by Chriſt's ſufferings was no ſtrict fulfilling of the Law threat, but a ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filling the Law of Mediation or Redemption, for the Soul that ſinned was to die; though for the ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on given by Chriſt a ſtop was put to the execution of the Law threat. When Perſons ſay that the ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Chriſt gave by his ſufferings was a fulfilling of the threatning, part of the Law of Innocency which Man had broken, 'tis a great miſtake, for in what was threatned by the Law, was included corporal diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempers, and ſpiritual and eternal death and damnati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. But Chriſt though he ſuffered did not ſuffer after this ſort, or in this kind, and therefore as is plain his ſufferings could not be a ſtrict fulfilling of the threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning part of this Law; though yet obſerve his ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings were for us and in our place and ſtead: But yet ſo as God did mercifully accept of theſe ſufferings of Chriſt, as a ſufficient ſatisfaction inſtead of that which we deſerved to ſuffer for ever.</p>
                     <p>Satisfaction is not the giving or paying the ſame which was due in Law; but it is the giving or paying ſomething to the offended party which is equivalent, or that doth amount to as much as though that ſame had been given or paid which was due in Law; 'tis
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:31257:52"/> granted by the moſt of Divines that Chriſt, though he did not, nor could not ſuffer the <hi>Idem,</hi> or that ſame which was due to us, yet as his ſufferings were a ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction, they were the <hi>Tantundem;</hi> they were equiva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent, yea, infinitely more in value, than the ſufferings of Mankind in Hell, for theſe could never have paci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied an offended God, made atonement, nor procured new terms of Peace, being only the ſufferings of finite Beings; but the ſufferings of Chriſt were the ſufferings of an infinite Being; <hi>i. e.</hi> the ſufferings of that Perſon who is God as well as Man, and therefore muſt have an infinite virtue and efficacy in their own nature. <hi>Acts 20. 28. Take heed therefore unto your ſelves, and to all the flock, over which the Holy Ghost hath made you overſeers, to feed the Church of God, which he hath pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſed with his own blood.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But did not Chriſt fulfill the Law by his Paſſive Obedience?</p>
                     <p>I Anſwer, Firſt, There is a ſtrict fulfilling of the Law by Paſſive Obedience, and that is when the very ſame in kind is ſuffered which was threatned, this Chriſt neither did nor could ſuffer, as hath been ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed above. Secondly, There is a virtual fulfilling of the Law, by Paſſive Obedience, and that is when ſatisfaction is given hereby to the Lawgiver, who hath left himſelf a liberty to accept of ſuch ſatisfaction, and ſo diſpence with the threat as to its chief and main execution, and thus Chriſt by his ſufferings may be ſaid to have fulfilled the Laws threat.</p>
                     <p>But Chriſt was our Surety, and as ſuch he muſt be under the ſame obligation with us.</p>
                     <p>For Anſwer to this, let us enquire in what Senſe Chriſt cannot be ſaid to be our Surety, and then in what Senſe he may.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. Then Chriſt in undertaking for Sinners was not ſuch a Surety, as bound himſelf to pay or diſcharge their Debt in caſe of non payment, upon good Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity from them: There are ſuch Sureties as theſe,
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:31257:52"/> as oblige and bind themſelves to a Creditor for others, upon good Security from them, ſo that if the Creditor come upon theſe Sureties in caſe of the real Debtor's non-payment, they again may come to ſave them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves harmleſs upon the Debtor, or ſuch as were bound for him. But Chriſt was no ſuch Surety for us, he did not engage to pay our Debts upon good Security from us, that we would pay them our ſelves, or if we did not, he might by virtue of our Security recover his own of us. I think none will ſay Chriſt was ſuch a Surety as this.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Chriſt was not ſuch a Surety as put himſelf into the ſame bond with us, and obliged himſelf to pay the ſame in kind which was due unto us; for let us put the Queſtion, Whether he was immediately upon Man's tranſgreſſions bound over to ſuffer by the Laws threat, or did voluntarily engage himſelf to make ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction for Man's offence? If the former, then he muſt have been bound for Man's performance of the condition of the firſt Covenant; for if he was not, How could he have been immediately bound over to ſuffer by the Laws threat? Immediately to fall under the penalty for the non-performance of another, ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth he that doth was bound for that other he ſhould perform; and if it be thus, then Chriſt muſt have been a Surety for Innocent Man that he ſhould per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form perſonal, perfect, and perpetual Obedience, and ſo the firſt Covenant muſt have Chriſt a Mediatour and Surety, and yet Man fell too. If he did volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarily engage himſelf to ſuffer for Man's offence, then I ask by what Law? If it be ſaid by the Law of Works, in putting himſelf under it as Man's Surety, I grant under the <hi>preceptive</hi> part of this Law Chriſt put himſelf voluntarily, and therefore is ſaid to be <hi>made under the Law.</hi> But that he was under the <hi>penal</hi> part, ſo as that the Law did account him Man's Surety, that had bound himſelf in the ſame bond with him to ſuffer for him in caſe he did tranſgreſs, this could not
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:31257:53"/> be; for this runs us upon the former, <hi>i. e.</hi> that Chriſt muſt be bound for Man as his Surety upon the draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up of the firſt Covenant, while Man was yet in his integrity, to ſuffer the puniſhment threatned in caſe he did tranſgreſs: or elſe how could the Law as they ſay immediately proceed againſt him in binding him over to puniſhment upon Man's offence? and if it be ſaid, he voluntarily put himſelf into our bond upon the breach of the Covenant, then it muſt be proved, that the Law did make proviſion for and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept ſuch a Surety for fallen Man, and his ſufferings for his diſcharge from the penalty due; and if it be ſo then this Law muſt immediately without any more to do acquit Man from guilt, and ſo be a pardoning Law, which yet curſeth and condemns all Mankind as tranſgreſſor; for obſerve if a Law do accept of the ſufferings of another in my ſtead who have violated the Law, it muſt acquit and diſcharge me from pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſhment which was due hereupon.</p>
                     <p>It may be ſaid were not the ſufferings of Chriſt in our ſtead and place? I Anſwer, yes, though not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted by the Law as ſuch but by the Lawgiver: for as I have ſaid, ſo I ſay again if they be accepted by the Law of Works in our place and ſtead, then it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not chuſe but be a pardoning Law, and if ſo it muſt be the ſame with the Goſpel. Hence then</p>
                     <p n="1">1. Chriſt is ſuch a Surety as interpoſed for us, and obliged himſelf freely to make ſatisfaction for us poor offenders, who were altogether inſufficient.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Chriſt is ſuch a Surety, as by the conſent of his Father did make ſatisfaction, or give a valuable con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration for our acquitment and diſcharge from the Curſe and Condemnation of the Law, upon condition that we offenders ſhould have no benefit by this his ſatisfaction but in and through and from him, and that upon his own appointed terms.</p>
                     <p>Seeing I have above put the Queſtion by what Law Chriſt was bound to ſuffer, I ſhall a little more fully
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:31257:53"/> and diſtinctly reſolve it, before I paſs further. Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſh we of Laws.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. There is the Law or Covenant of Works made with Innocent Man; that Law which promiſed the continuance of Life and Happineſs upon condition of perſonal, perfect, and perpetual obedience, and threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Man with everlaſting death upon his diſobedience. Now this Law firſt, did not only bind us to obey God our Creator, and Rector, but Chriſt alſo as Man, for Chriſt conſidered as God Creator and Rector, he cannot be under a law given to his Creatures; but then as Man partaking of the ſame Nature with us, he muſt be under this law as binding him to obedience, I mean, as to the preceptive part. But then Secondly, This Law tranſgreſſed by us, doth only bind us to ſuffer puniſhment, not Chriſt; and the reaſon is becauſe the Law doth not bind any to ſuffer the penalty it threatens, before it by them be violated and broken; now we have violated and broken the Law, and it binds us over immediately to ſuffer the puniſhment threatned, but not Chriſt, and that becauſe Chriſt conſidered as Man was ever Innocent, and never in the leaſt violated or broke the Law of Works, and therefore could not be bound by this Law to ſuffer the penalty, not for himſelf, it may be ſaid, but yet for us as our Surety; I Anſwer, No, he was not bound for us by the Law of Works to ſuffer as our Surety, and that becauſe the Law of Works reveals nothing of, nor makes any proviſion for a Surety.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. There is a Covenant or Law of Grace, and by this Chriſt was neither bound to Obedience, nor ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering; for the Covenant or Law of Grace, it com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands Faith and Repentance, and threatens damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the unbelieving and impenitent: But Chriſt is not by this Law or Covenant to believe or repent: indeed he hath bound himſelf in the promiſſory part of this Covenant to give the ſaving bleſſings thereof to all believing and penitent Sinners; but he is not bound
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:31257:54"/> by the preceptive part to repent and believe, or by the threatning part to ſuffer in caſe he do not.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. There is the Law of Mediation, that which Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines call the Covenant of Redemption, in which he freely engaged to purchaſe our Redemption, and this is the Law by which Chriſt was bound to ſuffer for us, to ſatisfie, and make atonement, and this both by his Father's appointment, and his own free conſent. <hi>John 10. 17, 18. Therefore doth my Father love me, becauſe I lay down my life, that I may take it again. No Man taketh it from me, but I lay it down of my ſelf, I have power to lay it down, and I have power to take it again. This commandment have I received of my Father.</hi> It is plain from this Scripture that Chriſt was obliged by no Law, but his Father's command, and his own con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, and in what Law ſhall we find the Father's com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand to Chriſt to lay down his Life, and Chriſt's free conſent thereunto, but in the Law of Mediation? As thus, ſuch a Man hath committed a capital Crime; <hi>i. e.</hi> a Crime that deſerves Death, another freely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents and engageth to ſuffer in his ſtead; now this Man that thus freely conſents and engageth himſelf, no Law previous to his own conſent and engagement doth bind him thus to ſuffer for the other, ſeeing he is Innocent as to the Crime, and ſo cannot be charged with the Crime the other is guilty of, and this was the caſe in Chriſt's ſuffering for us; ſo that from what hath been ſaid, it is granted that Chriſt as our Surety hath ſuffered in our place and ſtead; but that this was according to the intention or direction of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of Works, this I deny. I will grant that if the Covenant of Works had not been broken, Chriſt had not been our Surety, nor ſuffered to ſatisfie Juſtice, and make our atonement; but then that eventually, Chriſt actually became our Surety, was from the purpoſe of an all-wiſe, juſt, holy, and merciful God above and beſides either the intention or direction of the Law of Works. <hi>Him hath God ſet forth to be a Propitiation for Sin.</hi> Rom. 3. 25.</p>
                     <pb n="87" facs="tcp:31257:54"/>
                     <p>As it is ſaid before, he became actually Surety by his own free offer to make ſatisfaction to the juſtice of God by his Death, for Man's breach of the Law of Works, and God he accepted the offer, and this not according to any thing intended of this nature in the Law of Works; but of his meer grace and good plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure towards us, and yet with a deſign both to ſecure the glory of his own juſtice and holineſs, and to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare the glory of his own Wiſdom and Mercy, and to keep up the repute of his Law which Man had willfully violated.</p>
                     <p>Theſe things are clear from Scripture.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. That God accepted of the offer of Chriſt's Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatourſhip, or Suretiſhip of his meer good pleaſure. <hi>Having predeſtinated us unto the Adoption of Children by Jeſus Christ to himſelf according to the good pleaſure of his will.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="2">2. That God accepted of this offer with a deſign to advance the glory of his Juſtice. <hi>Rom. 3. 26. To declare, I ſay at this time his righteouſneſs; that he might be just, and the juſtifier of him which believeth in Jeſus.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="3">3. That he might advance the glory of his Wiſdom and Mercy. <hi>Epheſ. 1. 6, 7, 8. To the praiſe of the glory of his grace, wherein he hath made us accepted in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved. In whom we have redemption through his blood, the forgiveneſs of ſins, according to the riches of his grace. Wherein he hath abounded towards us in all wiſdom and prudence.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="4">4. That he might keep up in the World the repute of his Holy Law, in that he would not diſpenſe with the breach thereof without ſatisfaction. <hi>Iſa. 42. 21. The Lord is well pleaſed for his righteouſneſs ſake, he will magnifie the Law, and make it honourable.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="2">2. It is through Chriſt, in the ſecond place by his meritorious and ſatisfactory righteouſneſs, procuring the grant of a remedying Covenant or Law of Grace, a Covenant or Law of Grace ſuited to Man in his
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:31257:55"/> lapſed or fallen ſtate; for whereas it was become na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally impoſſible for fallen Man to have Juſtification or right to Life by the Law of Innocent Nature. Chriſt he purchaſeth a new Law, that ſhould be a remedy to fallen Man, notwithſtanding his violation of the firſt Law: So that now if Man do perform the conditions of the Covenant of Grace, his Sin ſhall be pardoned, and he ſhall have right to Life; ſo that it is Chriſt who hath purchaſed the new Covenant, and it is upon the account of Chriſt's Merits that God will mercifully accept the obedience which this Covenant requires (inſtead of that Innocency which the Law of perfect Works called for, I mean works without any Sin attending them, or works performed by an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent Creature) and juſtifie, and give right to Pardon and Life thereupon. When I ſay that God upon the account of Chriſt's Merits will mercifully accept the obedience which the Covenant of Grace injoins in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of that Innocency the Law of ſinleſs perfect Works called for; the meaning is not, as ſome are prone to imagine, that our Evangelical or Goſpel O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience will anſwer that law, or be accepted by that law, or that that law will juſtifie us upon that Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, No, no, for it is only the obedience of Chriſt that anſwers that law, removes the Curſe of it, and merits Pardon for our breach of it; but the meaning is, that whereas God might in juſtice after Man's wilful fall, have inſiſted upon the very terms of that law which was violated, he was pleaſed in his abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant free grace and rich mercy for the ſake of Chriſt, to declare by the new Covenant, that now he would accept of the ſincere Obedience of poor Sinners, and account them Subjects united to Chriſt, and as ſuch having right through him to Pardon and Life, which is his juſtifying of them. Now becauſe not only ſuch as profeſs themſelves <hi>Socinians;</hi> but alſo thoſe that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to be Enemies unto them do deny the Covenant of Grace to be purchaſed by Chriſt, exclaiming againſt
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:31257:55"/> me at a great rate, and ſaying, O, he is wrong in the very foundation, he holds Chriſt hath merited the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of Grace, when it is only the free gift of the Father. I judge it a fit place under this head a little more fully to correct the <hi>Socinian</hi> Spirit in theſe Men, who yet know not it is any ſuch thing that they are in the leaſt poſſeſt with; and this by clear proof from Scripture, that Chriſt hath purchaſed this Covenant.</p>
                     <p>That then which conſtitutes the Covenant of Grace betwixt God and Man is God's gracious promiſe on his part of the gift of ſaving benefits to Man, and Man's engagement on his part through the grace of God to perform all that which may give him right unto and intereſt in the promiſed benefits. Now if I prove from Scripture, that there is no ſaving benefit which God promiſeth to give unto Man, nor yet any grace which is required of Man to give him right unto and intereſt in theſe benefits: but Chriſt hath purchaſed them, I hope I ſhall ſufficiently have diſcharged my province in proving the Covenant of Grace to be pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſed by Chriſt.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. In the firſt place let us conſider the benefits that by God are promiſed, or offered in the Promiſe to Man, and as we go along prove that they are pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſed by Chriſt.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. God promiſeth Juſtification. <hi>Iſa. 45. 25. In the Lord ſhall all the ſeed of</hi> Iſrael <hi>be juſtified, and ſhall glory.</hi> Chriſt hath purchaſed Juſtification, <hi>Rom. 5. 8. 9. But God commendeth his love towards us, in that while we were yet ſinners, Christ died for us: Much more then being now juſtified by his blood, we ſhall be ſaved from wrath through him.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="2">2. God promiſeth reconciliation and peace, <hi>Iſa. 27. 5. Or let him take hold of my ſtrength that he may make peace with me, and he ſhall make peace with me.</hi> Chriſt hath purchaſed this, <hi>Rom. 5. 10. For if when we were enemies, we were reconciled to God by the death of his Son; much more being reconciled, we ſhall be ſaved by life.</hi> Coloſ. 1.
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:31257:56"/> 21, 22. <hi>And you that were ſometimes alienated and enemies in your mind by wicked works, yet now hath he reconciled In the body of his fleſh through death, to preſent you holy, and unblameable, and unreproveable in his ſight.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="3">3. God promiſeth remiſſion of Sin. <hi>Iſa. 43. 25. I, even I am he that blotteth out thy tranſgreſſions for mine own ſake, and will not remember thy ſins.</hi> And this is purcha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by Chriſt. <hi>Matth. 26. 28. For this is my blood of the New Teſtament, which is ſhed for many for the remiſſion of ſins.</hi> Epheſ. 1. 7. <hi>In whom we have redemption through his blood, according to the riches of his grace.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="4">4. God promiſeth Redemption, <hi>Pſalm 34. 22. The Lord redeemeth the Soul of his ſervants, and none of them that truſt in him, ſhall be deſolate.</hi> Chriſt hath purcha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed this Redemption from Sin. <hi>Titus 2. 14. Who gave himſelf for us, that he might redeem us from all iniquity, and purifie unto himſelf a peculiar People, zealous of good works.</hi> From Hell and wrath. 1 <hi>Theſ. 1. 10. And to wait for his Son from Heaven, whom he raiſed from the dead even Jeſus, who delivered us from the wrath to come.</hi> From the Curſe and Condemnation of the violated Law. <hi>Galat. 3. 13. Christ hath redeemed us from the curſe of the Law, being made a curſe for us: for it is written, Curſed is every one that hangeth on a tree.</hi> From the power of the Devil. <hi>Heb. 2. 14. Foraſmuch then as the Children are partakers of fleſh and blood, he alſo himſelf likewiſe took part of the ſame, that through death he might deſtroy him that had the power of death, that is, the Devil.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="5">5. God promiſeth Adoption, 2 <hi>Corinth. 6. 17, 18. Wherefore come out from among them, and be ye ſeparate, ſaith the Lord: and touch not the unclean thing, and I will receive you. And will be a Father unto you, and ye ſhall be my Sons and Daughters, ſaith the Lord Almighty.</hi> And this is by Chriſt merited. <hi>Galat. 4. 5. To redeem them that were under the Law, that we might receive the adopti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Sons.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="6">
                        <pb n="91" facs="tcp:31257:56"/>6. God promiſeth Eternal Life. <hi>John 3. 16. For God ſo loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whoſoever believeth in him ſhould not periſh, but have ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting life.</hi> Chriſt hath purchaſed this. <hi>Epheſ. 1. 14. Which is the earneſt of our Inheritance, until the redempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the purchaſed poſſeſſion unto the praiſe of his glory.</hi> Rom. 5. 21. <hi>That as ſin hath reigned unto death, even ſo might grace reign through righteouſneſs unto eternal life, by Jeſus Chriſt our Lord.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>This I have proved that the rich benefits promiſed by God, which are his part of the Covenant, are pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſed by Chriſt.</p>
                     <p>I will proceed to prove alſo that what Grace is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired of Man to give him right to and intereſt in theſe benefits of the Covenant is purchaſed by Chriſt.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. We cannot have right to, nor intereſt in any of the above mentioned benefits without Repentance, for without Repentance we muſt periſh. <hi>Luke 13. 3. I tell you, Nay: but except ye repent, ye ſhall all likewiſe periſh.</hi> Chriſt hath purchaſed this. <hi>Acts 5. 31. Him hath God exalted with his right hand, to be a Prince and a Saviour, for to give repentance to Iſrael, and forgiveneſs of ſins.</hi> And for certain Chriſt gives nothing but what he hath purchaſed, or the Spirit for this end to work it.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. We cannot have right to, nor intereſt in any of the above mentioned benefits without Faith, he that believes not, the wrath of God abideth on him. Now Chriſt hath purchaſed this. <hi>Philip. 1. 29. For unto you it is given in the behalf of Chriſt, not only to believe on him, but alſo to ſuffer for his ſake.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="3">3. We cannot have right to, nor intereſt in any of the above mentioned benefits without ſincere Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, which is virtually included in our firſt conſent to be the Lord's. <hi>Heb. 5. 9. And being made perfect, he became the Author of eternal Salvation, unto all them that obey him.</hi> And this Chriſt hath purchaſed. <hi>Titus 2. 14. Who gave himſelf for us, that he might redeem us from all
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:31257:57"/> iniquity, and purifie unto himſelf a peculiar People, zealous of good Works.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>This I have alſo proved, that what is required on our part Chriſt hath alſo purchaſed; and if Chriſt have purchaſed all that which conſtitutes the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant; <hi>i. e.</hi> God's gracious promiſes, and grace to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able us to perform the duties required to give us a right to and intereſt in the above mentioned benefits, then let the Reader judge, whether he be of the foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that holds Chriſt hath purchaſed the Covenant, or he that denies it.</p>
                     <p>It is through Chriſt furthermore, that Souls have right to Pardon and Life upon true Faith, as God upon the account of his Meritorious Righteouſneſs, and all prevailing Interceſſion, communicates ſtill fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and further aids of Grace for Believers perſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance. As Faith and Repentance are required by the Goſpel to our initial Juſtification or right to Chriſt, and the benefits of Pardon and Life through him, ſo perſeverance in Grace is required to our continued and final Juſtification. <hi>He that endureth to the end the ſame ſhall be ſaved.</hi> And Chriſt hath merited perſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring Grace. <hi>John 10. 10. The thief cometh not but for to ſteal, and to kill, and to deſtroy: I am come that they might have Life, and that they might have it more abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly.</hi> Epheſ. 5. 25, 26, 27. <hi>Husbands, love your Wives, even as Chriſt alſo loved the Church, and gave himſelf for it; That he might ſanctifie and cleanſe it with the waſhing of water by the word. That he might preſent it to himſelf a glorious Church, not having ſpot, or wrinkle, or any ſuch thing: but that it ſhould be holy, and without blemiſh.</hi> Heb. 2. 19. <hi>For it became him for whom are all things, and by whom are all things in bringing many Sons unto glory, to make the Captain of their Salvation perfect through ſufferings.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>From what hath been ſaid we ſhall Obſerve, That none of Mankind now can be accounted righteous, and ſo have Juſtification by the Law that injoins ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:31257:57"/> perfect Works, for if ſo, we muſt in the account of the Law be ſinleſs and perfectly righteous: And if ſo, it muſt either be by having ſuch a Righteouſneſs of our own; but this cannot be, there being no meer Man that hath ſuch a ſinleſs perfect Righteouſneſs of his own as this Law requires; or Secondly, It muſt be by having ſuch a Righteouſneſs of anothers; but this cannot be, for there is no Righteouſneſs of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that can anſwer the Law of Innocent Nature, but Chriſt's; and this Law neither doth nor can ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count us ſinleſs and perfectly righteous with Chriſt's Righteouſneſs; for if it ſhould or could account us perfectly righteous, by accounting the Righteouſneſs of Chriſt in it ſelf to be ours; or accounting us per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly to have obeyed and fulfilled it in Chriſt's Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience: It muſt account us to be thus righteous, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther abſolutely, or upon performance of ſome condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by it required. If upon the performance of ſome condition, it muſt either be the condition it required of ſinleſs Man, which is perſonal, perfect, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual Obedience; and if we could perform this we ſhould not need Chriſt's Righteouſneſs at all; for there had been no neceſſity of Chriſt's Righteouſneſs, if Man had continued to have performed a perſonal perfect Righteouſneſs: or it muſt be upon the performance of the condition of a ſincere Repentance and Faith: But the Law of Innocent Nature reveals not, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore cannot preſcribe ſuch a condition, upon the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of which it will account us perfectly righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous through or by Chriſt's Righteouſneſs; for if it did, 'tis evident there would have been no need of God's publiſhing the new Covenant, or of promul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gating the Goſpel. If it account us to be thus righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, abſolutely without any condition at all, then it either accounts all Mankind to be perfectly righteous by Chriſt's perfect Obedience; or only ſome part of Mankind: if it account all Mankind to be perfectly righteous through Chriſt's Righteouſneſs, then all muſt
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:31257:58"/> have Juſtification, or a right to Life, and none of Mankind muſt periſh, and if ſo, then we muſt have univerſal Salvation. If it account only ſome to be perfectly righteous with Chriſt's Righteouſneſs, then it muſt conſider them either as Elect, or non-elect; if it do not conſider them as Elect, then the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned conſequence is eſtabliſhed. If it conſider them as Elect, then the Law of Works muſt conſider them as Sinners, and ſo make proviſion for the Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of ſome, and none for the Salvation of others, that which I do not know, any that will undertake to prove. But if it ſhould be granted that the Law of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent Nature abſolutely, without requiring any con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of them ſhould account the Elect righteous up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Chriſt's perfect Obedience or fulfilling of it; then it muſt follow that Chriſt's ſufferings are a meer nul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, and there is no need of them: for if upon Chriſt's active Obedience the Law do account all the Elect ſinleſs and perfectly righteous (which it muſt do if it account them righteous perſonally with Chriſt's Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs) and juſtifie them as ſuch who have perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly obeyed Chriſt's perfect Obedience, then it cannot require ſuffering too, ſeeing that it only calls for ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering in caſe it have not the actual Obedience it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires. And it muſt follow further that there is no need of a Covenant of Grace, nor Repentance and Faith commanded therein, if the Law of ſinleſs Works do account us perfectly righteous in Chriſt's perfect obeying it for us. But none of theſe things can be, as is plain if Perſons will lay aſide prejudice and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider. And if ſo, that cannot be ſound and true which ſome have affirmed, that Chriſt and we are one Legal Perſon, or that Chriſt and Believers are one Perſon in Law Senſe, the Law accounting that what Chriſt did they did</p>
                     <p>But it may be ſaid, when Perſons become true Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers then the Law of Works <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap> them righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous with the Righteouſneſs of Chriſt, this is as much
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:31257:58"/> as to ſay, the Law of Works juſtifies upon Perſons performing of the condition of the Goſpel, and it knows nothing of, nor doth it preſcribe any ſuch con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, and ſo if it juſtifie, it muſt juſtifie upon terms unknown, and therefore unpreſcribed in it ſelf, and thus it is made a ſort of a blind juſtifying Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>

                     <p>HAving ſhewn how it is through Jeſus Chriſt that God doth aſſert and will maintain our right to Pardon and Life: I ſhall proceed to ſhew what Faith is, which is the thing required to give us right. <hi>John 3. 16. Acts 13. 39. Acts</hi> 16. 31.</p>
                     <p>An acute Author gives us this Deſcription of it, 'tis a believing acceptance of Chriſt a Saviour, it is a ſhort one, but yet a full one; for it implies Firſt, Aſſent, Secondly, Conſent, and Thirdly, our reſolved fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing of Chriſt in his way, truſting and relying up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him whatever we meet withal.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, It implies Aſſent, to theſe following things.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. That by Nature we are all loſt periſhing Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, for how ſhould a Man look after, or be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned about Salvation by Chriſt, if he be not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced of, and give his aſſent unto this, <hi>i. e.</hi> that in himſelf he is in a loſt helpleſs condition. <hi>Luke</hi> 19. 10.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. That Sin hath brought Mankind into this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, Man was not in a periſhing caſe, as he came forth of God's hands; but Sin hath made him miſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able; a Subject liable to all the Miſeries of this Life, and to the Pains of Hell for ever. <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. 12. 18. and 6. 23.</p>
                     <p n="3">
                        <pb n="96" facs="tcp:31257:59"/>3. That God made Man ſinleſs and upright, Man came not out of God's hands a crooked, but a ſtraight piece of Work: He had not only the Natural but Moral Perfections which he was capable of, God ſaw all that he had made, and it was good; <hi>i. e.</hi> had the Perfections which were ſuitable and agreeable unto its Nature. <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 7. 29.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. That as God made Man a ſinleſs upright Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and capable of Moral Government, ſo ſinleſs and perfect Obedience from Man became due unto God.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. That God gave Man a Law as the Rule of his Obedience, and this Law did require of Man perſonal, perfect, and ſinleſs conſtant Obedience, promiſing Life upon his Obedience, and threatning Death up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his Diſobedience.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. That this Obedience the Law required was due unto God from Man, as his abſolute Owner, rightful Governour, and great Benefactor: for whom ſhould Man obey, but him who made him, hath the abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute diſpoſe of him, the abſolute Authority over him, and from whom he hath all his good.</p>
                     <p n="7">7. That we have by our Sin violated the righteous Law of an Holy God, alienated and eſtranged our ſelves from him, caſt off his Government, and made our ſelves voluntarily Vaſſals and Slaves to Satan, and thus have caſt off our beſt good and laſt end, and are turned to the Creature, and ſo have forſaken God the Fountain. <hi>Jer.</hi> 2. 13.</p>
                     <p n="8">8. That by this our Sin we have brought upon our ſelves the doleful Curſe and Condemnation which the Law threatned againſt the Tranſgreſſors.</p>
                     <p n="9">9. That we cannot deliver or ſave our ſelves from this curſed condemned ſtate; ſeeing that 'tis impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble that he who hath once ſinned ſhould be accounted by the Law an Innocent Perſon, or one that never ſinned; and ſo alſo it is impoſſible that finite Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures who are Tranſgreſſors, ſhould ever pay a ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:31257:59"/> Ranſom, or the full price of Redemption to offend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Juſtice.</p>
                     <p n="10">10. That there is need of a Saviour or a Redeemer for ſuch poor loſt undone Creatures, one that may be an Innocent Perſon, and able to make full ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to God for Man's offence.</p>
                     <p n="11">11. It implies an aſſent that there is a Saviour, and this Saviour is appointed by God, and that he is able to ſave, yea, mighty to ſave.</p>
                     <p n="12">12. That this Saviour is the only begotten Son of God given and ſent by God for this purpoſe. <hi>John</hi> 3. 16.</p>
                     <p n="13">13. That God by the Goſpel did reveal and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe this Saviour to our firſt Parents upon their Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtacy. <hi>Gen.</hi> 3. 15. And ſo alſo to us. 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. 9. 10.</p>
                     <p n="14">14. That this Goſpel in which Chriſt a Saviour is revealed is true, the very truth of God. <hi>Coloſſ.</hi> 1. 5.</p>
                     <p n="15">15. That it was the meer love and mercy of God that moved him to give and ſend his Son to be a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, no previous deſerts in Man could be the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive. 1 <hi>John</hi> 4. 9, 10.</p>
                     <p n="16">16. That Chriſt our Saviour is true God, of the ſame Eſſence with the Father, equal in Power and Glory. <hi>Rom.</hi> 9. 5.</p>
                     <p n="17">17. That Chriſt that he might be a fit Saviour though he was God yet became Man, not that he ceaſed to be God, but by becoming what he was not, God and Man in one Perſon for ever. It was fit he ſhould be Man that he might obey, and God that his obedience might be meritorious: it was fit that he ſhould be Man that he might ſuffer, and God that his ſufferings might be ſatisfactory. <hi>Heb. 2. 14. 16. Philip. 2. 6, 7, 8. John 1. 14. Galat.</hi> 4. 4.</p>
                     <p n="18">18. That he was conceived by the Holy Ghoſt in the Womb of the Virgin <hi>Mary;</hi> and born of her, and that without Sin. <hi>Matt. 1. 20. Luke</hi> 2. 6, 7.</p>
                     <p n="19">19. That his Name was given him according to his Office, and the great work appointed for him by the
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:31257:60"/> Father; <hi>i. e.</hi> Jeſus, becauſe he ſhould ſave his People from their Sins. <hi>Matt.</hi> 1. 21.</p>
                     <p n="20">20. That this Lord Jeſus having lived upon Earth, in perfect conſtant Obedience without the leaſt Sin, teaching and preaching the way of Salvation, work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing many Miracles for the teſtimony and confirmation of the Divinity of his Perſon, and the truth of his Doctrine and Office; he freely gave himſelf to be a Sacrifice for our Sins to pay our Ranſom, and make our Atonement in ſuffering the ſhameful and painful Death of the Croſs, and alſo to free us from the Curſe of the Law. <hi>Heb. 4. 15. Heb. 7. 26. Heb. 2. 3, 4. Titus 2. 14. Heb. 9. 26. Matt.</hi> 20. 28.</p>
                     <p n="21">21. That he expired, died, or gave up the Ghoſt upon the Croſs. <hi>Luke</hi> 23. 46.</p>
                     <p n="22">22. That he was taken from the Croſs and laid in the Grave. <hi>Luke</hi> 23. 53.</p>
                     <p n="23">23. That he roſe again the third day; though he did really die, and was laid in the Grave, yet he ſaw no corruption, he could not be holden by the bonds of Death, but aroſe by his own Power. <hi>Luke 24. 46. Acts.</hi> 10. 40.</p>
                     <p n="24">24. That he about Forty days ſpace after his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection aſcended triumphantly into Heaven, in the ſight of many Witneſſes. <hi>Luke 24. 50, 51. Acts 1. 3. 9, &amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="25">25. That he is advanced Lord over all in Dignity, Honour, Power, and Glory with the Father. <hi>Acts 10. 36. Acts</hi> 2. 36.</p>
                     <p n="26">26. That he hath by the Goſpel purchaſed a Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant or Law of Grace, and appointed that thoſe in and among the Adult ſhall be ſaved, who do unfeign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly repent, believe in him, and love him above all things, and perſevere in the following of him in the ways of Holineſs unto the death. <hi>Acts 2. 38. Epheſ. 6. 24. Heb. 5. 9. Revel.</hi> 22. 14.</p>
                     <p n="27">27. It doth imply on the contrary, that ſuch as do not ſincerely repent, believe, and obey the Goſpel,
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:31257:60"/> and perſevere in the ways of Holineſs, they ſhall loſe Salvation, and have Damnation for their everlaſting portion. <hi>Luke 13. 3. John</hi> 3. 18.</p>
                     <p n="28">28. That Chriſt hath appointed and ſet up a Goſpel Miniſtry, and injoined them to cry aloud, to give Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners warning, to offer them terms of Peace, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeech them to be reconciled.</p>
                     <p n="29">29. That though Chriſt be aſcended and exalted in Heavenly Glory, yet he is appointed by the Father to be the judge both of the quick and dead, and will render to every one according to their Works. <hi>Acts</hi> 10. 42.</p>
                     <p n="30">30. That though he be now exalted on the right hand of the Majeſty on high in Heaven, yet he will deſcend from thence with Angels and glorified Spirits, and will by his glorious and mighty Power raiſe all the bodies that now are, and ſhall be then found ſleeping in the duſt, in order to judgment and a final ſentence. <hi>Acts 1. 11. 2 Theſſ. 1. 7. John</hi> 5. 28, 29.</p>
                     <p n="31">31. That all both good and bad, that ever have been, now are, or ſhall be in this World, ſhall be ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered before him; the good ſhall as Sheep be ſet up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his right hand, and the bad as Goats upon his left. <hi>Matt.</hi> 25. 31, 32, 33.</p>
                     <p n="32">32. That he will ſentence thoſe upon his right hand to everlaſting Happineſs, but thoſe upon his left to eternal Puniſhment. <hi>Matt.</hi> 25. 34, to 41.</p>
                     <p n="33">33. That according to the ſentence given by Chriſt the righteous and impartial Judge, ſo muſt execution be done both upon the good and bad; there ſhall be no appealing from his ſentence, nor no repealing of it. <hi>Matt. 25. 46. Matt.</hi> 3. 12.</p>
                     <p>Let Perſons conſider upon the matter, that there are none that aſſent to the truth of this aright, that Chriſt is a Saviour, but they do and muſt aſſent unto the truth of all theſe things which are above mentioned. And ſeeing that Chriſt a Saviour will ſave and do<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="100" facs="tcp:31257:61"/> the Son; it will be neceſſary to know what truths we muſt aſſent unto with relation to the Spirit.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. An aſſent, That he is true God of the ſame Eſſence with the Father and the Son, and that ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears, ſeeing thoſe who are baptized are to be baptized into the Name of the Holy Ghoſt, as well as into the Name of the Father and Son. <hi>Matt. 28. 19. Go ye therefore, and teach all Nations, baptizing them in the Name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghoſt.</hi> He is expreſly ſaid to be one; <hi>i. e.</hi> one God with the Father and the Son. 1 <hi>John 5. 7. For there are three that bear record in Heaven, the Father, the Word, and the Holy Ghoſt: and theſe three are one.</hi> Thoſe that lie or act hypocritically they lie or deal hypocritically to God; and this God is the Holy Spirit as well as the Father and the Son. <hi>Acts 5. 3, 4. But Peter ſaid, Ananias why hath Satan filled thine heart to lie to the Holy Ghoſt, and to keep back part of the price of the land? Whilſt it remained, was it not thine own? And after it was ſold, was it not thine own power? why haſt thou conceived this thing in thine heart? thou haſt not lied unto Men, but unto God.</hi> We find Omniſciency and Omnipotency attributed unto him. <hi>Iſaiah</hi> 40. 13, and ſo on, <hi>Who hath directed the Spirit of the Lord, or being his counſellor hath taught him?</hi> &amp;c. 1 Corinth. 2. 10. <hi>But God hath revealed them unto us by the Spirit: for the Spirit ſearcheth all things, yea the deep things of God.</hi> He is both the Author of Gifts and Grace, 1 <hi>Corinth. 12. 11. But all theſe work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth that one and the ſelf ſame Spirit, dividing to every Man ſeverally: as he will.</hi> We find the work of Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion aſcribed unto him. <hi>Pſalm 104. 30. Thou ſendeſt forth thy Spirit, they are created: and thou reneweſt the face of the earth.</hi> Immenſity or Infiniteneſs is attributed unto him, he is omnipreſent. <hi>Pſalm 139. 7. 8. Whither ſhall I go from the Spirit? or whither ſhall I flee from thy preſence? If I aſcend up into Heaven, thou art there: if I make my Bed in Hell, behold, thou art there.</hi>

                     <p>The Power of the Higheſt or Almighty God is aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cribed unto him, <hi>Luke 1. 35. And the Angel anſwered and ſaid unto her, The Holy Ghoſt ſhall come upon thee, and the Power of the Higheſt ſhall overſhadow thee: therefore alſo that Holy thing which ſhall be born of thee, ſhall be called the Son of God.</hi> We find the fitting and furniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Chriſt for the Office of Mediatour or Redeemer is attributed unto him, <hi>Iſa. 61. 1, 2. The Spirit of the Lord God is upon me, becauſe the Lord hath anointed me to preach good tidings unto the meek, he hath ſent me to bind up the broken hearted to proclaim liberty to the captives, and the opening of the priſon to them that are bound. To proclaim the acceptable year of the Lord, and the day of vengeance of our God, to comfort all that mourn.</hi> The Miraculous work of caſting out Devils is aſcribed unto him. <hi>Matt. 12. 28. But if I caſt out Devils by the Spirit of God, then the kingdom of God is come unto you.</hi> He may be ſinned againſt unpardonably. <hi>Matt. 12. 32. And whoſoever ſpeaketh a word againſt the Son of Man, it ſhall be forgiven him: but whoſoever ſpeaketh againſt the Holy Ghoſt, it ſhall not be forgiven him, neither in this world, neither in the world to come.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="2">2. An aſſent that this Spirit as to its perſonality pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedeth both from the Father and the Son: Hence we find him ſometimes called the Spirit of the Father. <hi>Matt. 10. 20. For it is not ye that ſpeak, but the Spirit of your Father which ſpeaketh in you.</hi> Sometimes the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of the Son. <hi>Galat. 4. 6. And becauſe ye are Sons, God hath ſent forth the Spirit of his Son into your hearts crying Abba, Father.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="3">3. An aſſent that he hath his miſſion, or is ſent both from the Father and the Son. <hi>John 14. 16, 17. 26. John</hi> 15. 26.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. An aſſent that this Spirit was ſent both from the Father and the Son for theſe ends and purpoſes. 1. To move and infallibly guide thoſe who were Prophets and Apoſtles, that they might perfectly declare the Doctrine of Chriſt reſpecting our Salvation. 1 <hi>Peter</hi>
                        <pb n="102" facs="tcp:31257:62"/> 1. 10, 11, 12. 2. By many and plain Miracles and wonderful gifts this Holy Spirit might be the great witneſs of Chriſt, and of the certainty of his bleſſed and holy word. <hi>Heb.</hi> 2. 3, 4. 3. To take up the Hearts of all true Believers for his habitation, and ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate powerfully and ſavingly in them. 2 <hi>Corinth. 6. 16. Philip.</hi> 2. 13.</p>

Into one Church, which is the body of Chriſt. 1 <hi>Corinth.</hi> 12. 12, 13.

That they may live in hope of Chriſt's coming and eternal Life. 1 <hi>Theſſ. 1. 10. 2 Theſſ.</hi> 3. 5.</p>
                     <p>The ſumm of theſe things may be found in the <hi>Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſterſhire</hi> Agreement. Now I ſhall put the Queſtion, Whether is not the belief of all theſe above-mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Articles included in a Perſon's believing in Chriſt a Saviour, and if they be, whether can any one (I ſpeak of the Adult) have Salvation by Chriſt who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies theſe, and refuſe to give their aſſent unto them? If they cannot, how can they be juſtified without ſuch an aſſent? Being thus, it may be ſaid, you will have many aſſenting acts of Faith unto Juſtification, or in that Faith which juſtifies. I Anſwer, implicit I will grant, explicit I deny. As thus, Suppoſe I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound the above-mentioned Articles to any in order to his aſſent, as I read theſe Articles, if he give cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:31257:62"/> he implicitely gives his aſſent to each Article, as I go along: But then after that I have read them, I ask him whether he doth aſſent to the truth of the whole, if he ſay, yea, 'tis manifeſt his explicit aſſent is but one, or one explicit act, which we call aſſent.</p>
                     <p>But beſides aſſent, our conſent is requiſite to the conſtituting of true Faith, and this conſiſts beſt in a cordial accepting this one only God to be our God, giving him the preheminence in our affections. <hi>Exod. 20. 2, 3. An accepting of him to be our chief or beſt good, that God who is eſſentially good, the fountain of all good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. Hence he is the principal object of our love, deſire, and delight.</hi> Pſalm 73. 25. <hi>Whom have I in Heaven but thee? and there is none upon earth I deſire beſides thee.</hi> And beſides it implies a free conſent to be diſpoſed of by him according to his good pleaſure, and a being free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly willing to be ruled and governed by him accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to his Law and holy Commands.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. A conſent to take Chriſt Jeſus to be our only Propitiation, all prevailing Interceſſour, and alſo as our head and Teacher; <hi>i. e.</hi> Chriſt in all his Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. An accepting of the Holy Spirit to be our Sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fier, to mortifie Sin, to bring our hearts in love with holineſs, to aſſiſt us in duty, and excite grace in the performance, to alienate our Hearts from this World, and fix them upon Heaven and heavenly things.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. A ſincere conſent to perform our Baptiſmal Vow or Covenant, renouncing the World, the Fleſh and the Devil, reſolving through God's grace for the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to be his obedient Children and faithful Servants, fighting againſt all his and our ſpiritual Enemies. Thoſe who are our Oppoſites, I would gladly know of them, or rather I deſire them to know of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, whether any leſs than ſuch a ſincere conſent as this above ſpoken of can bring or put them into a ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving juſtified ſtate, or give them (which is all one) a ſaving intereſt in Chriſt, and a right to Pardon and
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:31257:63"/> Life through him? If they ſay, leſs will, let it be made appear from Scripture; if not, then why do they make any oppoſition? upon this conſent ſincerely given follows practical truſt; <hi>i. e.</hi> a well grounded confidence upon God in and through the Lord Jeſus by the Holy Spirit, that God for the ſake of Chriſt will be faithful to his promiſes, and make them good unto ſuch who reduce their former conſent into per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſevering practice, ſuch who by patient continuance in well doing ſeek for Glory, and Honour, and Immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality, Eternal Life. <hi>Rom.</hi> 2. 7. Though many times under dark and afflicting providences and diſpenſations. Thus <hi>Abraham</hi> againſt hope believed in hope, he ſtaggered not at the promiſe of God through unbelief, but was ſtrong in Faith, giving glory to God: And being fully perſwaded that what he had promiſed, he was able alſo to perform, upon our firſt aſſent and conſent we have an initial right to Chriſt and Life: upon our practical truſt we have this right continued, which practical truſt doth include ſincere Obedience, and when a Believer is incapacitated for the act and exerciſe, the principle or habit is accepted. <hi>The heart of Aſa was perfect all his days.</hi> 2 Chron. 15. 17.</p>
                     <p>This practical truſt is our adherence to God in Chriſt by the bleſſed Spirit, in the ways of holineſs notwithſtanding oppoſition. <hi>Acts 11. 23. Who when he came, and had ſeen the grace of God, was glad, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horted them all, that with purpoſe of heart they would cleave unto the Lord.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Having ſhewed what a Faith it is which is requiſite both to our initial and continued Juſtification, or what Faith it is which is requiſite both to our initial and and continued right to Chriſt, and to Pardon and Life purchaſed by him. Let us now conſider what this Faith includes, as it gives the initial right, and ſo I conſider it eſpecially as conſiſting in conſent, aſſent being previous.</p>
                     <p n="1">
                        <pb n="105" facs="tcp:31257:63"/>1. Repentance is included, for in our ſincere con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent to take God to be our God, Chriſt to be our Redeemer, which includes an accepting him in all his Offices, and the Holy Spirit to be our Sanctifier, there is implied a cordial confeſſing and forſaking of all Sin, and this with ſelf loathing, ſelf judging, enmity, and oppoſition in the Heart againſt it.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Love to God and the ways of holineſs is inclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded; for it cannot be that ever any ſhould ſincerely conſent to be the Lord's, and make choice of the ways of holineſs to walk in, unleſs there be ſuch a ſight of their excellency and amiableneſs as draws their Love from Sin and the World, and fixeth it principally here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. This conſent includes Obedience radically, for there can be no real conſent to be Chriſt's, unleſs there be a full reſolution to do and ſuffer whatſoever he calls us unto, this conſent we ſpeak of brings Chriſt and Souls into the Relation of Maſter and Servants; and there cannot be a real conſent to be Chriſt's Servants, unleſs there be a willingneſs to do the work which he commands us, and a reſolution through Grace to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue in it, ſo that it is manifeſt that Faith which juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies or gives right to Pardon and Life, it includes Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, Love to God, and radically new Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence; and though it is like upon the matter, I may procure to my ſelf the name of a Papiſt, I muſt not for that be affrighted from owning a truth that bears its own evidence before it: But by the way, I would have ſuch Perſons who are ſo ready to fix ſuch names upon others as they judge may render them odious to conſider, what our Divines mean when they ſay that where there is one Grace, there is every Grace; and tell me where there is the act and exerciſe of that Faith which unites to Chriſt, whether there can be this without the exerciſe of Repentance and Love incluſive? what hath been ſaid may give ſufficient light to know how to anſwer the Queſtion, to ſuch as
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:31257:64"/> deſire to learn, and think not themſelves wiſe enough already. Though ſeeing I am upon this, I ſhall take leave further to offer this to conſideration, and let it be under correction, that where there is the exerciſe in truth of Grace, the exerciſe of that one Grace, (I ſpeak of the ſenſible exerciſe) doth include the exerciſe of the moſt, if not the exerciſe of all Grace. As thus, Suppoſe we the exerciſe of true Repentance, there muſt be a real willingneſs in the Soul that ſincerely repents, to deliver over himſelf to be taught and ruled by Chriſt: and to truſt to God's ability and faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs by virtue of his promiſe to Pardon, and ſave him through and for Chriſt's ſatisfaction and Merits, which is Faith. And where there is this Faith, ſuch a Soul muſt hate Sin, and love God in Chriſt, and his grace and favour above the beſt of this World; and where there is ſuch a love there muſt be ſelf denial, the Soul muſt be free to let all go for its part in God and Chriſt, and the things above. And where there is this ſelf denial, there muſt be an heart actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally diſpoſed patiently to bear and endure all the trials and troubles the Soul may meet with, and thus the affections muſt be heavenly and the Souls greateſt hopes muſt be there. Though ſome may quarrel at this, as they are ready to do at all things which have not their ſentiments to be their meaſure and Rule: yet I do think this much may be a great help unto a Soul under darkneſs and caſting down, and ſo in the exerciſe of true humiliation, for if it can but clear up this, it may have ground to conclude the reſt of the graces are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded or are exerciſed implicitely. I look upon one grace drawn forth into exerciſe, to be as the Wheel in a Clock, which ſet upon motion, the reſt move together with it.</p>
                     <p>But to offer further light upon the matter, I am in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined to think that one grand occaſion of Perſons miſtakes at this day about the great Article of Juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, is their looking at and inſiſting upon the
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:31257:64"/> Prieſtly Office of Chriſt, ſo as that they regard little, or very much overlook his Prophetick and Kingly Office, not that we exclude the Prieſtly Office: But let us ſee to it in our believing that we have ſuch a Faith as accepts of whole Chriſt, Chriſt in all his Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices, and not ſuch a Faith as pitcheth upon his Prieſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Office only, for this is no other but a dividing of Chriſt; therefore whoever they are that do not look at whole Chriſt, and embrace him in all his Offices as the object of that Faith which juſtifies they are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a miſtake. The Apoſtle counſels the diſtreſſed Jaylor, when he ſeriouſly enquired what he might do to be ſaved to believe on the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, was not the Faith here ſpoken of ſuch a Faith as gave right to and intereſt in Chriſt and Covenant benefits? And what as ſuch did it only reſpect Chriſt as Prieſt? If ſo, then my conſent to take Chriſt in part, or to take Chriſt as Prieſt will give me a right and intereſt in him as divided from my conſent to take him as a Prophet and King, and will it ſo? no ſurely, for know that we can have no right to Chriſt nor benefit by him as a Prieſt, unleſs we conſent to take him as Prophet to teach, and King to rule us, is evident from Scripture, <hi>Acts 3. 22, 23. For Moſes truly ſaid unto the Fathers, A Prophet ſhall the Lord your God raiſe up unto you, of your Brethren like unto me, him ſhall ye hear in all things whatſoever he ſhall ſay unto you. And it ſhall come to paſs, that every Soul which will not hear that Prophet, ſhall be deſtroyed from among the People.</hi> Luke 19. 27. <hi>But thoſe mine enemies which would not that I ſhould reign over them, bring hither, and ſlay them before me.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>There are theſe few things which I would gladly have Perſons underſtand, which if they do, and make a Chriſtian uſe of them, they need not much to trouble themſelves with diſputes upon the matter, though they ſhould by degrees endeavour to increaſe in knowledge.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. Chriſt hath merited all ſaving bleſſings.</p>
                     <p n="2">
                        <pb n="108" facs="tcp:31257:65"/>2. Perſons ſo long as impenitent and unbelieving have no right to nor intereſt in Chriſt, or any of his purchaſed benefits. But</p>
                     <p n="3">3. So ſoon as God gives Souls the Grace to turn from Sin, and give their unfeigned conſent. 1. To take Chriſt as the meriter of all ſaving good. 2. As the ſatisfier of offended Juſtice. And, 3. Become ſincerely willing to be taught and ruled by him as Prophet and King.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. Reſolve through his Grace to walk in all Holy Obedience before him.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. Depend upon his Mediatour and interceſſion alone for the acceptation of all their ſervices and duties, then they have a right unto him, and intereſt in all his benefits, and are moſt certainly in a juſtified ſtate.</p>
                     <p>Now whereas ſome Perſons affirm that all our Righteouſneſs is as filthy rags; If they mean by our Righteouſneſs a meer external hypocritical Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs where there is neither the Truth nor exerciſe of Grace, I grant them this as filthy rags, 'tis an abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation to God: But if they mean by our Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs true Repentance, Faith, ſincere Love, and Goſpel Obedience, that this is as filthy rags, an abomination to God, this I deny, and the Scripture that is brought to prove the contrary, doth not intend it; <hi>i. e.</hi> Iſa. 64. 6. but only an hypocritical Righteouſneſs for the Prophet in the Verſe foregoing ſaith, <hi>Thou meeteſt him that rejoyceth, and worketh righteouſneſs, thoſe that remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber thee in thy ways.</hi> And if ſo then that Righteouſneſs here ſpoken of, cannot be an abomination to God; for God will not meet, own, or grant ſuch his graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous preſence who work an abomination, neither will he account ſuch to <hi>remember him in his ways.</hi> The Sacrifice of the wicked indeed is an abomination to the Lord; but the Prayer of the upright is his delight, And the Righteous Lord loves Righteouſneſs, and his countenance beholds the upright. But now ſaith the Prophet implicitely confeſſing Sin in the perſon of the
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:31257:65"/> People, They are but few that are ſuch as rejoyce and work Righteouſneſs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> for take us generally and we are ſo degenerate and hypocritical, that we are but as an unclean thing, and all our Righteouſneſs are as fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy rags, and what is added, Verſe 7th. is a further proof of this Expoſition. <hi>And there is none that calleth upon thy name, that ſtirreth up himſelf to take hold of thee,</hi> which cannot certainly be meant of the ſincere, or thoſe ſpoken of at the 5th Verſe. But if this Expoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion will not give content, let Perſons read the Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies Annotations, and <hi>Pool</hi>'s Engliſh Annotations upon the place, and thoſe that can may conſult <hi>Pool</hi>'s <hi>Criticks in locum,</hi> and ſee wherein I and they differ. And there are ſuch as are for having our ſincere Chriſtian Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs to be no better than filthy rags will find three of the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Church to be of their mind. Not that I think this to be any argument, ſuppoſe what they hold to be a truth, but I alledge it becauſe theſe Men profeſs themſelves ſuch Antipapiſts, as that they judge it a ſufficient Argument (ſo far as I find by ſome of them) againſt what others hold, that is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradictory to them, if a Papiſt do but hold it, or ſeem ſo to do.</p>
                     <p>But ſay they again, Did not <hi>Paul</hi> account his Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Righteouſneſs, the beſt of his grace dung? I An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, no, if we may believe his own expreſs words, for he ſaith <hi>Philip.</hi> 3. 8. that he counted <hi>all things but loſs for the excellency of the knowledge of Chriſt Jeſus his Lord;</hi> and was his knowledge of Chriſt no part of his Chriſtian Righteouſneſs? or was it no Grace? or did it not include Faith? if ſo, then how could he ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count it dung? or how did he ſo? But it may be ſaid, Suppoſe that a Perſon be ſincere, and a true Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever, Doth not Sin attend the beſt of his Graces and Duties? I Anſwer, Yes, for certain. But then is Grace and ſincere Obedience in it ſelf or in its own nature Sin? Surely no. Perſons would do well if they would diſtinguiſh betwixt Grace and Sin, I am ſure
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:31257:66"/> God doth, and that both thoſe that are in Heaven and Hell know; Sin, I grant, is dung and filth wherever it is, but ſo is not Grace, true Grace. Indeed I muſt ſay to ſuch as are ſincere Chriſtians, you have cauſe and occaſion to bewail and beg Pardon for the want of the free exerciſe of Grace; <hi>i. e.</hi> of Repentance, Faith, love to God, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> in duty. But then do you, or ever did you mourn and grieve and ſorrow becauſe you have Grace? I trow not. And what is it which hinders the free exerciſe of Grace but Sin; this you are to bewail, and crave pardon for, and believe aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuredly that your duties cannot be accepted without the Mediation and Interceſſion of Chriſt.</p>
                     <p>Well, but it may be ſaid further, our Repentance and Faith we account them only dung in point of Juſtification, I Anſwer, they are ſo I grant, if either you or I ſet them in Chriſt's place, or make them that which they neither are, nor can be; <hi>i. e.</hi> the merit of our Juſtification, or a meritorious Righteouſneſs; but they are not ſo, as they are appointed by God in the Goſpel to give right unto, and intereſt in Chriſt.</p>
                     <p>For let me ask Perſons whether they think that God doth ever accept any of the ſervices and duties of his People? Muſt they not ſay yes, through Chriſt and his Mediation? And ſo ſay I, I do not expect the beſt of my duties ſhould be accepted any other way. Well then, if God accept the ſervices of his People, I ask again, whether God will accept of Sin or no? muſt it not be ſaid no; if ſo, that God will accept of his Peoples duties, and yet neither can nor will accept of Sin, then how can their duties be Sin? But it may be ſaid again, our beſt ſervices are no better than Sin till they be offered up by Chriſt, I Anſwer, ſtill I grant that Sin attends our beſt ſervices, and ſo we need pardon in our beſt performances, and the Mediation of Chriſt for their acceptation: But now if our beſt ſervices in themſelves be no better than Sin, until Chriſt offer them up; then Chriſt doth either
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:31257:66"/> tender to God that which is no better than Sin in it ſelf; or elſe he makes our Chriſtian duties another thing than they were, and ſo offers them up to God: And if ſo, it is not the very ſervice he tenders, but another thing; a thing of another nature: and if ſo, the conſequence muſt be, that Chriſt doth not at all offer up a Believers ſervice to God. This then is that which I believe upon the matter.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. That God for Chriſt's ſake pardons the Sins that attend the ſincere ſervices of his People.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. So far as they are ſincere he is well pleaſed with them, and accepts them for Chriſt's ſake.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. Whoever they are who are not ſenſible of, and lament the Sins of their beſt duties: Look not unto, and reſt not upon the Merit of Chriſt for Pardon: And do not reſt alone upon Chriſt's Mediation and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terceſſion for their Acceptation, their duties cannot be pleaſing to God. And I ſhall take leave here to tell ſuch as make Conſcience of the performance of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian duties, if you have true Faith and the exerciſe of it in a duty, it will direct you to truſt to, and reſt in Chriſt alone and his Mediation for your acceptation. It is of the very nature of true Faith exerciſed in a duty to lead the Soul to reſt upon and truſt unto a bleſſed Mediator for its acceptance: and whoever they are who pretend to Faith, and yet do not make this uſe of Chriſt, I muſt tell ſuch their Faith is not true; for I ſay, it is of the nature of true Faith not to lead Perſons to reſt in themſelves, nor to reſt in their duties; but to reſt in a Mediatour alone for the acceptation both of their Perſons and duties, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I conclude, that if Perſons be ſuch as have true Faith, and the exerciſe of Faith in a duty, it is not poſſible for them to reſt in that duty, or in themſelves as performers of it.</p>

                     <p>MUCH hath been ſaid to caution Perſons againſt reſting in their Duties and Graces, and I am ſatisfied was well meant, and I do not deny but that Perſons may reſt, yea, and I am afraid too many do reſt in their Duties, but that any Perſon doth reſt in the performance of Duty, where Grace is in exerciſe, this I deny. For when a Perſon in the performance of Duty doth reſt upon Chriſt and his Mediation for Acceptation; 'tis either one that hath Faith, and the exerciſe of it; or it is as he who is deſtitute of Faith and ſo of the exerciſe of it; If the former, manifeſt it is, that where there is true Faith in its exerciſe, that Soul cannot but reſt upon Chriſt; if the latter, then the conſequence muſt be ſuppoſing that a Perſon per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form Duty, that is deſtitute of true Faith, and ſo with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the exerciſe of it; he is a Perſon that reſts upon Chriſt, and whoſe duties ſhall be accepted when yet the Scripture ſaith, that <hi>without Faith it is impoſſible to pleaſe God.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Touching Perſons truſting in their Graces, and making Saviours of their Graces, I affirm in like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, that where there is the truth and exerciſe of Grace, it is impoſſible for that Perſon to reſt in his Grace, or make a Saviour of it, and that becauſe (as before) it is of the very nature of Grace to lead thither from whence it came; <hi>i. e.</hi> to God in Chriſt as the Souls reſt and Center, whatſoever is from our ſelves, leads us into our ſelves; but whatſoever is from God, as a moral good, tends towards God. Well, but ſay ſome, though Grace be from God, and ſo be good; yet it no ſooner paſſeth through us, but it is defile<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>. I
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:31257:67"/> wonder for my part what notion Men have of this Alluſive term paſſing through, or when they ſay that grace paſſeth through us: but I ſhall let that paſs, as a thing I underſtand not, neither I think they that uſe the Phraſe. But if Grace be defiled ſo ſoon as we are the ſubjects of it, or ſo ſoon as it is given unto us or wrought in us, then how comes it by this defilement, it muſt either be from ſome change, or it remains what it was; if it be from ſome change that it is defiled, ſeeing that this defilement muſt be moral, then it muſt partake of the nature of Sin, and if ſo, it muſt ceaſe to be Grace, and if it do, and become Sin, as it muſt if it partake of moral pollution, then in whom will mortifying and ſanctifying Grace be found? If Grace remain what it was, and it was pure and good, as granted, as it had the Spirit as its Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor, then how comes it to be defiled? I do not deny, but there is Sin, and much Sin, where Grace is, but then that this Sin pollutes Grace, ſo ſoon as it is given, and ſo it becomes morally defiled, and partakes of the nature of Sin, this I cannot reach, for I think that what is morally evil muſt be ſin, and what is morally polluted, muſt either be ſin or ſinful; and to ſay, ſinful Grace and Holineſs ſounds harſh.</p>
                     <p>But (it may be ſaid) doth not a true Chriſtian exalt and ſet up his grace above Chriſt in a time of tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to ſpiritual pride, becauſe of his grace, if the temptation prevail? I Anſwer, in a time of tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to pride, if the temptation prevail, a Perſon that is a Chriſtian, doth exalt and ſet up himſelf; but he cannot be ſaid to ſet up and exalt his grace above Chriſt hereby, nor indeed doth he exalt grace at all, becauſe this exalting and high eſteem of himſelf, is a depreſſing of his grace, and a putting a ſtop unto its exerciſe, whereby he ſhould exalt Chriſt: ſo that grace cannot be the cauſe of this his pride, for it is againſt its nature; but the ſuppreſſing of grace, or a putting a ſtop to its exerciſe, by the prevalency of the contrary corruption.</p>
                     <pb n="114" facs="tcp:31257:68"/>
                     <p>So then, you I ſay, a Man cannot be proud of his grace; I anſwer, he cannot be proud of his grace, that hath his grace in exerciſe, becauſe a Perſon is never more humble, nor is God in Chriſt ever more exalted by him, than when grace in him is moſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſed: for it is of the very nature of true grace to depreſs ſelf, lay low the Creature, and exalt God and Chriſt, ſo that the more of grace and the exerciſe of grace, and the more of this.</p>
                     <p>But may not a Chriſtian be proud of the exerciſe of grace? I Anſwer, he may be lift up in himſelf, and proud of himſelf after the exerciſe of grace, not that this exerciſe is the cauſe hereof, it may be an acciden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal occaſion, but then it is the abuſe both of grace and the exerciſe of it. The truth is, Chriſtians, if you would be ſecured from ſpiritual pride, be kept hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, labour to be much in the exerciſe of grace, fear not that the exerciſe of grace ſhould lead you to reſt either in it, or in your ſelf, for it is againſt the very nature of it, the more of the exerciſe of grace, the more doth the Soul take up its reſt in God through Chriſt.</p>
                     <p>It is very ſtrange in ſome Men, O, ſay they, you muſt caſt away all your graces and ſincere duties, and account them as dung, and reſt wholly upon Chriſt and his Righteouſneſs, juſt as though there was ſuch an inconſiſtency and oppoſition betwixt Chriſt and the graces of his Spirit, and Holy Obedience, as that Chriſt and his Righteouſneſs could not be relied upon and truſted to for acceptation, except we laid by grace and ſincere duty as uſeleſs here, when for my part it is a matter quite beyond my reach, to know how, or with what, or in what to rely upon Chriſt and his Righteouſneſs for my acceptation without grace and the exerciſe of it in holy duties, for think I, if I rely upon Chriſt and his Righteouſneſs, I muſt have ſome way in which, and ſomething by which I muſt thus rely, or how can I?

                        <pb n="115" facs="tcp:31257:68"/> Men will have neither, if both grace and ſincere duty muſt be accounted and caſt away as dung here: O, but ſay they, you muſt beware of reſting upon your grace, and ſincere duties for your acceptation, and ſo of making a Chriſt of them; I Anſwer, for my part I do not fear this, if I have but the truth and exerciſe of grace, for God hath given grace, and draws forth grace into exerciſe for this very end, that Perſons ſhould reſt upon and truſt unto Chriſt's M diation for their acceptation; and ſure I am, grace where it is in act, will act according to its nature, and this is to lead the Soul that hath it towards God in Chriſt, as its center and reſt, and therefore if ſome Perſons will amuſe themſelves and others unneceſſarily, I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not help them: but I ſhall pray the Lord to meaſure my Faith, and quicken Grace, and grant me the free exerciſe of it in every duty, and then I know I ſhall be humble, advance Chriſt, and reſt upon him as my only Mediator to obtain for me the grant of all ſaving good, both Grace and Glory. For in whoſe Hearts ſoever the Lord is pleaſed to ſuppreſs Pride, Hypocriſie, and Formality; and keep them humble, ſincere, and lively in the practice of Piety; it is not poſſible but ſuch ſhould depend upon Chriſt both for pardon for the iniquities which attend their beſt duties, and alſo for their acceptation: for whoſe Hearts ſo ever are kept humble, ſincere, and lively in grace, and ſo in obedience, ſuch Perſons cannot chuſe but ſee and know their own ſinfulneſs, nothingneſs, ſpiritual emp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tineſs, as conſidered morally in themſelves; and ſo on the contrary admire and adore the grace of God in Chriſt Jeſus by the Holy Spirit, for any thing of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſhing grace and love towards their Souls, and is this ſome reſting in themſelves, and in their own graces and duties? The grace and love of God in Chriſt Jeſus, certainly is the moſt highly advanced in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and what is the rea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="116" facs="tcp:31257:69"/> the nearer any Soul upon Earth comes towards this Heavenly perfection, by the growth and exerciſe of grace, the more humble that Soul will be, and the more God in Chriſt will be adored and glorified in and by that Soul. <hi>John 15. 8 Herein is my Father glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified, that ye bear much fruit: ſo ſhall ye be my diſciples.</hi> So that while ſome Perſons caution others againſt reſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in their grace: I ſay, beware of Pride, Hypocriſie, and formality; and endeavour after the growth and exerciſe of grace, and then no danger, while grace is in its growth and exerciſe. I wiſh it be not the caſe of many Profeſſors, that while they are pretending highly to advance the Lord Jeſus, and to reſt in him, and truſt ſolely unto him, they do not content them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves much with formality, and take little care to ſee they have that grace in truth and the exerciſe of it by which the glory of Chriſt is exalted, and he reſted in as the only Saviour and Mediatour; for ſure I am, how high ſoever their pretences may be without true grace and fruitfulneſs in it, they neither do nor can do that which they themſelves pretend unto.</p>
                     <p>What ſome Men have been doing, and what their thoughts are as to matters of this nature, I ſhall leave, only they ſeem ſtrange to me; for after I have af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed that ſuch as have the exerciſe of true Faith and other graces, it is not poſſible while it is thus for them either to reſt in Grace or Duty: they in oppoſition have aſſerted that ſuch Doctrine is the high way to make formaliſts and hypocrites, but then you muſt know it was without proof, and it was like to be ſo; for ſure I am that ſuch as perform duties without true Faith, and the exerciſe of Grace, they have nothing wherewith to reſt upon Chriſt or his Mediation, and ſo muſt content themſelves with the work done, and theſe are and can be no other while it is thus but for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maliſts and hypocrites. What it is to ſome Perſons I know not, but to me it is a Paradox, that true grace and ſincere obedience ſhould lead off from Chriſt and
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:31257:69"/> God in him, and that Men ſhould be in danger there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by, while it is prevalent, to degrade Chriſt and ſet up themſelves: it is juſt as if a Man ſhould ſay, ſuch a Servant as is faithful, diligent in his Maſter's ſervice, and very obedient, his Maſter is in danger ſo long as he is ſuch to be robbed of his due honour by him, while yet the Maſter accounts it a credit and honour unto him to have ſuch a Servant, and loves him en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely, and intruſts him with thoſe ſecrets that he will not intruſt with the reſt, though know the Servant doth but what he ought to do in all this. And thus the beſt and moſt faithful of God's Servants, after all they have done in God's ſervice, muſt account them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves unprofitable to God, becauſe they make no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn of any thing unto him, but what they firſt have received from him through Chriſt by the Holy good Spirit, though obſerve where there is faithfulneſs they ſhall reap the profit, for God will for Chriſt reward his own work in them, and that which is done faithfully by them. <hi>He that comes to God, muſt believe that he is, and that he is a rewarder of ſuch as diligently ſeek him. Eliphaz.</hi> intimates, <hi>Job</hi> 22. 2. that <hi>though no Man can be profitable to God,</hi> yet a wiſe Man, one that is ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually wiſe, ſaith Mr. <hi>Caryl,</hi> may be profitable to <hi>him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf.</hi> And he hath this Obſervation upon the words, He that is truly Wiſe, Godly, and Holy ſhall find fruit and benefit by it, we car, ſaith he, never want fruit our ſelves, while we are bringing forth fruit unto God, all obedience, <hi>i. e.</hi> which is ſincere, is attended with a bleſſing. For my part with relation to what hath been ſaid, I do not think that any thing is accounted by God morally unclean and filthy but Sin; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore muſt be yet to learn that ſincere obedience to the commands of the Goſpel is Sin: if it be ſaid (as uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al) it is ſo, as it is in us. I Anſwer, as it is in us ſo Sin attends it, I grant as we are ſinful and unclean in our ſelves, and this Sin muſt needs be filthy and abomin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able but then that obedience which is the obedience
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:31257:70"/> of Faith and Love conſidered in it ſelf as abſtracted from our Sin, that this, I ſay, is filthy and abominable, I dare not affirm, but indeed muſt deny: for the principle muſt needs be the work of the Spirit, and the performance muſt be by the Spirit's aſſiſtance, and as ſuch then the obedience muſt be accepted of God. Now how that which is a work of the Spirit, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed by the aſſiſtance of the Spirit, and offered up to God by Chriſt through his interceſſion can be fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy and abominable in it ſelf, I ſhall leave under con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration, whether is it rational to think that Chriſt will offer up to God by his interceſſion that which is filthy? or ſuppoſe he ſhould, whether will God ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept it. But it will be ſaid (as before) it is only fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy in point of Juſtification; I Anſwer, if it be not filthy in point of acceptation through Chriſt and for his ſake, it cannot be filthy in point of Juſtification ſo far as it hath its uſe and office there, for will God ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept that for the ſake of Chriſt, which he will not ſo far as he accepts it, juſtifie us upon? God accepts of a Soul's ſincere obedience, which is the obedience of Faith through Chriſt, as it his Spirit's work, and a Conformity to the Goſpel Law; now what is Gods acceptation but his being pleaſed with the Soul and its ſervice through Chriſt, which well pleaſedneſs im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies his judging that Soul to be one that hath right, (as it is a ſincere obedient Soul ſtill for Chriſt's merits) to the bleſſings promiſed unto ſuch, and what is God's judging a Soul to have right but his juſtifying of that Soul? It is very odd to hear ſome Perſons in their confeſſions caſting away all that is in them, and all that is done by them in the ſpecial ſervice of God though ſincere as dung, and yet profeſs they will reſt and depend upon Chriſt's Interceſſion for the accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of that which they called and accounted dung; as though Chriſt would offer up to God on their ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count by his interceſſion, or that God would accept that which is as dung, and ſo filthy and abominable in
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:31257:70"/> a moral ſenſe. And then further theſe very Perſons in the ſame duty will thank God for any ground of hope he hath given of the truth of a work of Grace in their Hearts, and the exerciſe of Grace in the Duty, and the hopes they have had of the Spirits aſſiſtance, and yet all this before in their confeſſions they caſt away as dung. I do believe many have meant well in all this, and were for the main good Chriſtians; but plain it is matters were not ſo well conſidered as they ſhould have been here. Think of it, we have all Sin to bewail which attends us in our beſt ſervices, and to crave pardon for through Chriſt; but then ſo far as our Hearts are ſound and ſincere, and we find the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe of humiliation, Faith, and love to God in the performance of that ſervice; we have ground to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve it ſhall be accepted of God in Chriſt, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore may depend upon his Mediation for this very thing, being incouraged by God's gracious promiſe, and if ſo, we neither may, nor ought to look upon ſuch a ſervice in it ſelf to be dung, and ſo an abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation to God.</p>
                     <p>Now the reaſon that ſome give for accounting our Goſpel holineſs dung is this; <hi>i. e.</hi> becauſe of its in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmity and imperfection. This reaſon implies that all that Grace and Holineſs which is not a perfect con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity to the Law of Innocency is as dung, and ſo abominable to God, and ſure I am this looks odd on't; for is not this Grace and Holineſs a work of God? and is not every work of God perfect in its kind? hath not a perfection of parts been all along granted? and is there not an Evangelical perfection conſiſting in ſincerity, which hath been and is acknowledged by Divines? was it a ſtrict legal perfection, or a perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on conſiſting in ſincerity that <hi>David</hi> intended when he gave <hi>Solomon</hi> his Son the charge <hi>to ſerve God with a perfect heart?</hi> and ſo when it is ſaid of the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple they offered with a <hi>perfect heart. 1 Chron.</hi> 29. 9. Was that a ſtrict legal perfection in Heart and Life
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:31257:71"/> that was ſo ſweet to <hi>Hezekiah</hi> in the reflection, after he had received the ſentence of Death in himſelf. <hi>Iſa</hi> 38. 3. And ſaid, <hi>Remember now, O Lord, I beſeech thee, how I have walked before thee in truth, and with a perfect heart, and have done that which is good in thy ſight: and Hezekiah wept ſore.</hi> Mr. <hi>Caryl</hi> from that part of <hi>Job</hi>'s deſcription. This Man was perfect, ſaith, not that he had a legal perfection, ſuch a perfection as the Papiſts now contend for, and aſſert to be poſſibly attainable, yea, actually attained by many in this Life: But, ſaith he, the perfection here ſpoken of is the perfection of ſincerity, and he obſerves from the words after his explication. Firſt, It is ſincerity that eſpecially commends us to God. Secondly, Saith he, ſincere and ſound hearted Perſons are in God's eſteem perfect Perſons. It is not all that you can do, or all that you can ſay, or all that you can ſuffer, or all that you can loſe that can make you perfect in the eſteem of God without ſincerity; add ſincerity but to the leaſt, and it gives you the denomination of perfect. Thus far this Reverend Author, which Doctrine ſome Men call Popiſh, ſo well are they acquainted what Popiſh Doctrine is.</p>
                     <p>Some Men ſeperate Faith and good Works, and ſpeak of them ſo, as though there might be good Works without Faith. Now for my part, I know no good Works formally in a Theological ſenſe, but ſuch as are done in Faith, and I know nothing done in Faith that leads not to Chriſt and God in him, and therefore for Perſons to ſpeak of good Works as ſuch ſeperate from Faith, and to ſpeak of Faith leading the Soul off from Chriſt, is manifeſtly vain. Some Men will not grant that Faith is a qualification of right to Chriſt, and his benefits, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>et they ſay to juſtifie is to make one legally juſt, or juſt in Law; ſo ſay I, and can a Man be legally juſt without a legal righteouſneſs? and is not that which is a Righteouſneſs a quality?
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:31257:71"/> how then can a Man be juſt legally and not qualita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively? Find me a Man that ever was legally juſt, and yet not perſonally juſt in the ſenſe of that Law which accounted him juſt, and if perſonally juſt, then primarily inherently juſt, and if perſonally juſt, juſt in his nature. As I have ſaid above, ſo I muſt here ſay again, let it be proved that <hi>Thomas</hi> is a Perſon without the nature of a Man, or that the nature doth not go to conſtitute the Perſon; when I ſpeak of Faith as the qualifying matter in a Goſpel ſenſe, ſome Perſons have inferred from hence, that this is all I in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend in Juſtification, whereas there is the form (as I have ſaid) <hi>i. e.</hi> God's imputation by his Law of Grace, his accounting ſuch a Faith as accepts of Chriſt as our great Propitiation, Head, and Teacher, by this his Law for the ſake of Chriſt's ſatisfaction and Merit, for Righteouſneſs and <hi>forma dat eſſe.</hi> Hence their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference is a meer fallacy, <hi>à dicto ſecundum quid ad dictum ſimpliciter.</hi> Will the Goſpel aſſert a Perſon's right to Chriſt and his benefits before conformity thereunto? and when through grace any Perſon yields Conformi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, is it not a Goſpel Righteouſneſs? and is not a Goſpel Righteouſneſs <hi>jus quoad eam legem,</hi> a right in that Law to Chriſt, Pardon, and Life promiſed? and is <hi>jus ad rem,</hi> a right to a thing no qualification in a legal ſenſe? if not, then the conſequence muſt be, that a penitent Believer as ſuch ſubjectively hath no more actual right to Chriſt and Life according to the Goſpel promiſe then an impenitent Infidel; I ſpeak not of a right by merit, but both by qualification unto him that hath merited, and unto Pardon and Life merited by him for us.</p>
                     <p>Faith it ſelf as it is the Soul's firſt conſent to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept of Chriſt to be its Propitiation, Head, and Teacher is really Goſpel Obedience; <hi>Rom. 16. 26. But now is made manifeſt, and by the Scriptures of the Prophets, according to the commandment of the everlaſting God, made known to all nations, for the obedience of faith,</hi>
                        <pb n="122" facs="tcp:31257:72"/> and that becauſe it is the Soul's conformity to the Goſpel command. 1 <hi>John 3. 23. And this is his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment, That we ſhould believe on the Name of his Son Jeſus Chriſt, love one another, as he gave us com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment.</hi> And Faith thus conſidered is that which unites to Chriſt, and the qualifying matter which firſt gives the right. <hi>John 1. 12. But as many as received him, to them gave he power to become the Sons of God, even to them that believe on his Name.</hi> And as Faith is the Soul's conſent to accept of Chriſt, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent includes the Soul's free ingagement ſincerely to be ſubject to what Chriſt commands, ſo long as he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinues it in the World, in a dependance upon his power and faithfulneſs. And this ſincere obedience performed according to the Soul's firſt Covenant con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent during its abode in this World, is that whereby its right to Chriſt, and ſaving bleſſings is continued. <hi>Revel. 22. 14. Bleſſed are they that do his commandments, that they may have right to the tree of life, and may enter in through the gates into the City.</hi> And this is agreeable to the mind of a Reverend and Judicious Divine, as he Illuſtrates it by a Marriage Covenant including conſtant fidelity. And this Faith with him is a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition as it relates to the Covenant, and a Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in the ſenſe of the Goſpel as it is the performance of the condition. And when he ſpeaks of Chriſt's Righteouſneſs being the cauſe and matter of Juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, his declared ſenſe is the meriting matter, not that we might merit, but have that by virtue of his merit, which the Goſpel requires to give us right to Pardon and Life, and what is this but our ſincere con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, which is Faith?</p>
                     <p>Our Divines excluding good Works from the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of Juſtification, ſpoke of good Works with rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the Law of Innocency, (and indeed Evangeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Obedience will be no qualifying matter of right in the ſenſe of that Law) and that they did ſo is plain, foraſmuch as their argument is, becauſe they are im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect,
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:31257:72"/> perfect, therefore, (ſay they) it muſt be a perfect ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs Righteouſneſs, even the Righteouſneſs of Chriſt that muſt juſtifie, becauſe no other Righteouſneſs can be adaequate to the Law, and we ſay the ſame with them, that if we are juſtified by the Law of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocency, no leſs than a perfect ſinleſs Righteouſneſs would avail us here; but we are not, (as hath been made appear) but by the Goſpel: and though I affirm that Faith is our perſonal juſtifying Righteouſneſs ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Goſpel Law, yet it doth not follow from hence, that Believers ſhall ſtand upon their points with God in judgment according to his ſtrict Juſtice; no, they muſt ſay with <hi>David</hi> Pſalm. 143. 2. <hi>And enter not into judgment with thy ſervant; for in thy ſight ſhall no Man living be juſtified.</hi> But I ſay upon con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity to the Law of Grace, they have intereſt in Chriſt the Mediatour, and a right to his Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, upon which they do depend and truſt for the ſatisfaction of God's offended Juſtice, and the anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the violated Law, for the procuring of their ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptation with God, and a grant of all ſaving promiſed good: ſo that as to proceſs in judgment, my thoughts are that Believers ſhall not perſonally plead at all, but Chriſt as their bleſſed Advocate for them: But then this he will do for them as ſuch who have been, and are found <hi>recti in curia Evangelica,</hi> right in the Goſpel Law, which ſtill I ſay is and ſhall be the Rule of Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, <hi>Rom. 2. 16. In the day when God ſhall judge the ſecrets of Men by Jeſus Christ, according to my Goſpel,</hi> and ſo juſtified by this his fixed conſtitution. The ground I have is <hi>Matth.</hi> 25. from Verſe 34 to 41. Whereas ſome that they may hold their ungrounded and unſcriptural notions do confidently affirm that our Faith, Repentance, and ſincere Obedience hath only the place of an Evidence; I do not deny the Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience of Faith to be an Evidence, but then I muſt not confound but diſtinguiſh of its primary and ſecon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dary uſe and office, and the reſult of both, Chriſt
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:31257:73"/> ſaith, <hi>John 15. 14. Ye are my friends, if ye do whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever I command you.</hi> Dare any Man ſay they were friends actually, before any ſubjection to Chriſt? if not, was not this their ſubjection a conformity to the Goſpel ſo far as revealed? And is there any confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity to the Goſpel without Obedience to its com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands? And is there any Obedience to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands of the Goſpel in truth, which is not the <hi>obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of faith?</hi> Thoſe who will contradict, let them prove, and then take the cauſe. If they cannot, then they muſt give us leave, and if they will not, we muſt make bold to take it, it being allowed by one that is greater than they to diſtinguiſh of the Obedience of Faith, as it conſtitutes us friends through Chriſt's Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diation, continues us friends, and as it is an evidence reſulting from both, where God is pleaſed to give the light.</p>
                     <p>Say ſome, <hi>Job</hi> when accuſed by his friends for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing an hypocrite, pleads his own Righteouſneſs as much as any; But as to Juſtification thereby before God he ſpeaks otherwiſe, <hi>Job 9. 20, 21. If I juſtified my ſelf, mine own mouth ſhall condemn me: if I ſay, I am perfect, it ſhall alſo prove me perverſe, Though I were perfect, yet would I not know my Soul: I would deſpiſe my life.</hi> Now will this, or the other really and in it ſelf juſtifie a Perſon from the charge of hypocriſie before Men, that will not ſo far juſtifie him from the charge or accuſation in God's account? when a Perſon is falſly accuſed of hypocriſie as <hi>Job,</hi> muſt not he ſo far as he hath a diſcovery of his ſincerity, plead this to juſtifie him againſt that accuſation, and if he be ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere is he not ſo in God's account? and ſo clear of that predominant hypocriſie of which he is accuſed; and doth not God ſo far as he accounts a Perſon clear of a falſe accuſation juſtifie him? Let Perſons who contradict prove if they can, That ſincerity will only juſtifie a Perſon from the charge or accuſation of hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocriſie before Men, while yet the accuſation ſtand<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                        <pb n="125" facs="tcp:31257:73"/> in full force before God, and he accounts the Perſon who is in himſelf ſincere to be a downright hypocrite. The meaning then of the above quoted Text in <hi>Job</hi> ſeems to be this; If I juſtifie my ſelf as one unjuſtly afflicted by God this very Juſtification of my ſelf and charge uttered againſt God would be ſufficient to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn me; if I ſay I am in a ſtrict ſenſe legally per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, and ſo have no Sin, for which God may correct me, this very boaſting would prove me perverſe and ſinful: yea, though I were perfect, yet would I not know or look upon my ſelf as ſuch an one whom God might not deal withal as he pleaſed conſidered as ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute Lord and owner. Now to argue from this Text according to this clear Expoſition that Faith is no qualifying matter of right to Chriſt, Pardon and Life, is no better than to argue <hi>à bacculo ad angulum, ut patet attendenti.</hi> From what I have affirmed above, <hi>i. e.</hi> That there is no danger of a Soul's reſting in duties, where true Faith is in exerciſe, ſeeing the exerciſe of Faith will lead that Soul to reſt in Chriſt and God in and through him for acceptation; it hath been infer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, that ſuch as have throughly imbibed this opinion, are if unregenerate in the ſnare of Satan almoſt ſecure from conviction. And if this be ſo, then theſe Men who draw up ſuch a concluſion from the Doctrine have this to prove, look where they will find a proof, that whoever holds that there is no danger of a Soul's reſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in duty where true Faith is in exerciſe, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> he is in the ſnare of the Devil if he be unregenerate, and like to be, for this Doctrine will keep him there. And if this Doctrine be it that will keep an unregenerate Perſon in the ſnare of the Devil, how can any one be out of his ſnare that holds it; for if it be the Devil's ſnare, he that holds it muſt needs be in it: If then a Perſon have been regenerate before, yet according to this aſſertion, if he imbibe this Doctrine, it brings him back into the ſnare of the Devil, ſo that he muſt fall from grace, falling from a regenerate ſtate, and I for
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:31257:74"/> my part, by theſe Men ſentenced to the black Pit, and in their account there is no hope for me; but by the grace of God in Jeſus Chriſt, I do not dread their Sentence. This <hi>intus exiſtens prohibens alienum</hi> is very much to be lamented at this day, ſeeing it oppoſeth manifeſt truth.</p>
                     <p>I ſuppoſe the conſequences that I have deduced from the common Doctrine of Juſtification are very offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive to ſome, and they call them abſurd. But I ſay again, whoſoever they be that holds Chriſt's Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs in it ſelf to be their very perſonal formal juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying Righteouſneſs, the inferences are natural from the Notion, and whereas they are called abſurd, the contradiction betwixt the aboveſaid Doctrine and the inferences muſt be ſhewn, or elſe when Perſons call them abſurd they underſtand not what they ſay, <hi>Dans formam dat conſequentia formam.</hi> And hath it not been generally affirmed, That the Righteouſneſs of Chriſt conſidered as Mediatour, is made the Believers by Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation as really as if it had been wrought and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed by them: and it being the ſole matter of their Juſtification, they are made formally righteous here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon by God's Imputation? who knows not that hath read any thing almoſt, that the <hi>active</hi> and <hi>paſſive obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience of Christ</hi> by the moſt that have been accounted Orthodox hath been made the <hi>material,</hi> and God's <hi>Imputation</hi> the formal cauſe of our Juſtification. And yet ſome have made a challenge, ſaying, Where did any of our Orthodox Writers ever aſſert or intend that we were juſtified by the very formal, perſonal, numerical, intrinſick Righteouſneſs of Chriſt? Who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever imagined that the Righteouſneſs of Chriſt by Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation is made ours according to its univerſal value, but according to our particular neceſſity? I Anſwer, Certainly tell I cannot, who theſe Perſons mean by Orthodox Writers; but this I know, that many of thoſe Holy Men of God whoſe works are extant, and who were very Orthodox in their Lives, and in the
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:31257:74"/> moſt of things in their judgment alſo, yet held as much in this point of Juſtification as what is in the challenge comes to <hi>Mary,</hi> ſaith Mr. <hi>Norton</hi> in his Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodox Evangeliſt, <hi>under the Croſs was more juſt imputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively than Chriſt, which was alſo true of every believer then living.

Being united to Chriſt, we are intereſted in all his actions, as if they were ours, for when we are one with him in the Spirit, we are conſidered by God to be one with him in Law; therefore by union we are ſaid to put on Chriſt with all his perſonal merits and righteouſneſs, upon this God looks upon us as righteous, and this by the donation and application of Chriſt's Righteouſneſs, and this righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs muſt be in juſtification, and is ſuch a righteouſneſs as ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfies God's juſtice, and the Law.</hi> Now upon the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter I ask, can God look upon us as righteous, and this by the donation and application of Chriſt's Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, which is ſuch a Righteouſneſs as ſatisfies God's juſtice, and the Law; and put us on, upon union with Chriſt, with all his perſonal Merits and Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs,
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:31257:75"/> and yet we not have the very formal, perſonal, numerical, intrinſick Righteouſneſs of Chriſt? What is not a ſatisfactory and meritorious Righteonſneſs the very eſſential, formal, and numerical Righteouſneſs of Chriſt's Perſon as Mediator? And is not this affirmed to be imputed in it ſelf in our Juſtification, and to be in it ſelf our perſonal juſtifying Righteouſneſs? If not, why am I and ſome others ſo much oppoſed for the denying of it, and holding that it is only imputed unto us in its fruit and effects? If they affirm it is imputed or accounted by God to be in it ſelf our per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal juſtifying Righteouſneſs; then I ask, how can it be accounted ours in it ſelf for our Juſtification, and not be one and the ſame eſſential, formal, and perſonal Righteouſneſs of Chriſt as Mediator? can that be the Righteouſneſs of Chriſt in it ſelf, that is not one and the ſame eſſential formal Righteouſneſs which is Chriſt? If ſo, then we may ſay <hi>idem non idem,</hi> the ſelf ſame and not the ſelf ſame, which is manifeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly abſured and contradictory.</p>
                     <p>And whereas it is ſaid further, whoever imagined that the Righteouſneſs of Chriſt by Imputation is made ours according to its univerſal value? I Anſwer, he that ſays the Righteouſneſs of Chriſt is imputed in it ſelf, and not only in its bleſſed effects; how can it be it ſelf, and want its full value? let any Man find me that can, a Righteouſneſs of Chriſt as Mediatour that is not ſatisfactory to infinite juſtice, and merito<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious of all good, and is not here its full value? take away, as I have ſaid above, it's ſatisfactory and meri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious property from Chriſt's Righteouſneſs as Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atour, which is its value, and ſee then if that which remains can be the Righteouſneſs of Chriſt. I am afraid if ſome men were left to act according to their own notions, it would be an odd ſort of a Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs they would make at laſt to be their juſtifying Righteouſneſs, for according to what they ſay it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be Chriſt's, and Faith it muſt not be, and what
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:31257:75"/> then muſt it be, it is well if they know themſelves, for ſure I am I do not. And what can a Man think of that which remains? which is, that the Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Chriſt is made ours by Imputation according to our particular neceſſities. But that in the opinion of theſe Perſons God doth divide and parcel out Chriſt's Righteouſneſs one part to this, and another part to that Believer; and that ſome have need of more, and ſome of leſs, of it: and is this God's man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of the Imputation of Chriſt's Righteouſneſs? Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to theſe Men it is, but I ſay it is not; and for any to aſſert ſuch a thing is groſly abſurd. Indeed I had like to have ſaid this is a notion but of yeſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>days coining, but I find the ſubſtance both of this latter, and the former part of that I have now ſpoken to by Mr. <hi>Burgeſs,</hi> in his Book called, <hi>Vindiciae Legis,</hi> Pag. 135.</p>
                     <p>As for me, I ſay, I muſt either have intereſt in and a right unto the whole of Chriſt's Righteouſneſs, or I am undone; for no leſs than the whole will ſatisfie God's juſtice for any Soul, or merit Pardon and Life for it: And when I plead with God for Pardon, Life, and Acceptation, I plead the whole, and not a part only of Chriſt's meritorious and ſatisfactory Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs; but then obſerve, I plead it as it is proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Chriſt's as Mediatour, and ſo in it ſelf incommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable, though ſome Perſons ſpeak of its communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to us, which in its bleſſed fruits I grant, but in it ſelf I deny. For the Imputation of Chriſt's Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs in it ſelf, and againſt the Imputation of Faith as it unites to Chriſt, the greateſt Argument is Authority, what Orthodox Divines as they call them ſay; In Anſwer to which I ſhall ſay as the Divines did at the late <hi>Portſmouth</hi> Diſputation, <hi>My Religion is in the Bible,</hi> I own my ſelf a Proteſtant, and with ſuch it is a fundamental or Principle, that the greateſt and beſt of Men are fallible, and therefore our aſſent is not concluded by meer words of one or other name
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:31257:76"/> how great ſoever; we pay a very juſt deference to the Worthies theſe our Adverſaries intend, but we cannot think our ſelves obliged to believe every thing they have ſaid: we muſt not turn Papiſts yet, and ſatisfie our ſelves with a meer implicit Faith, a judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of diſcretion, whether ſome will allow us or not, we muſt make bold to take; It is not very ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal for Men to be angry, becauſe we will not ſhut our own Eves, and ſee altogether with other Mens. <hi>He that is firſt in his own cauſe ſeemeth juſt, but his Neighbour cometh and ſearcheth him.</hi>

                     <p>HAVING for avoiding the offence of good Men drawn up a Confeſſion of my Faith, and ſent it abroad for the ſatisfaction of ſome that were overmuch concerned at my de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livery of ſomething which diſguſted them in my preaching: A Friend of mine tranſcribed and ſent the ſame Confeſſion to one that goes under the Name of an <hi>Antimonian</hi> Preacher (what he hath that name for I know not) whom he knew, with others of his
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:31257:78"/> profeſſed who Friends had been hot againſt me: This being received, he, whether with others I know not, took himſelf ſo far concerned as that ſome time after whether by his doing or no I cannot tell, there came forth in his Name a Manuſcript conſiſting of 27 Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles of his Faith, and at the back of thoſe 25 Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogatives or Queries, all which were intended in op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition to me, though not by him ſent directly and immediately to me, I thought ſometimes it would not be worth the while to meddle with ſuch matter; but finding my Name ſo frequently made uſe of by him, and the Doctrine I had preached and writ even ſcorned and derided, I thought it no leſs than duty for the good of others; <hi>i. e.</hi> for their better in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation in the truths of the Goſpel, to take a little notice of, and animadvert a little upon ſome of the Articles of his Faith. In the firſt place,</p>
                     <p n="1">1. <hi>I believe, ſaith he, firſt, that the Juſtification and Salvation of poor ſinners had its beginning and riſe in God's eternal purpoſe of love and grace.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Anſwer, I deny not God's eternal purpoſe of love and grace; but I am far from thinking that any were juſtified from eternity, if that be intended by him in this Article: and that there is no ſuch thing, I have ſhewn above. And though God had an eternal pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe of love and grace; yet know God purpoſed to juſtifie and ſave none but by Jeſus Chriſt. I do not believe that God did decree the juſtifying or ſaving of any ſinner without Chriſt.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. <hi>I believe, ſaith he, that God in his eternal purpoſe and counſel ſecret to us, hath freely from the good pleaſure of his will choſen a certain number of Perſons to Salvation without reſpect to foreſeen Faith, Repentance, or any other work whatſoever as a condition of the grace of Election.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>I grant that neither Faith, nor Repentance, nor any other work foreſeen were the Impulſive or moving cauſes of God's choice of any; the Impeller being only God's free love and good pleaſure: but then that
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:31257:78"/> God did chuſe to bring any to Salvation who live under the Goſpel (I ſpeak of the Adult) without Faith, Repentance, and ſincere Obedience, this I deny.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. <hi>I believe, ſaith he, that in order to the manifeſting and bringing forth of the eternal purpoſe of grace and love for the Salvation of the Elect, a Covenant of Grace was made, paſt, and agreed upon between God the Father and God the Son in the early morning of eternity,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>I grant the Covenant of Redemption or Mediation had reſpect unto the Salvation of ſinners, and ſo the making of it with Chriſt was of Grace to them; but it was not a Covenant of Grace and Mercy with him as Man's Mediatour, who was by virtue of this Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant to fulfill the Law and ſatifie God's Juſtice. God indeed deals with ſinners in a way of Grace and Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy for Chriſt's ſatisfaction and Merit, but he did not deal in a way of Mercy and Grace with his Son as our Mediatour, but in a way of ſtrict juſtice. Here obſerve, he confounds the Covenant of Redemption with the Covenant of Grace.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. <hi>Saith he, I believe that this Covenant is a free, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mutable, and everlaſting Covenant that ſtands faſt in Chriſt with whom it was made, and in whom all the conditions of it are found.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>I grant (if he ſpeak of the Covenant of Mediation and Redemption made betwixt the Father and the Son) it was freely made on the part of both confede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates; <hi>i. e.</hi> the Father and the Son, and that Chriſt is the only performer of what was required on his part in this Covenant: But I do not think that Chriſt is bound unchangeably and everlaſtingly by this Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant to be fulfilling the Law in a ſtate of humiliati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and ſuffering of death upon the Croſs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and therefore as to Chriſt's performing the conditions of this Covenant it was not immutable and everlaſting, though as to the benefits and bleſſed fruits thereof, the enjoyment of which conſtitute everlaſting happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, it will be granted him it is ſo, we do not deny
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:31257:79"/> but affirm the Covenant of Mediation was betwixt the Father and the Son from before all time: But then that thoſe Texts he alledgeth, 2 <hi>Sam. 23. 5. Hebr. 13. 20. Ezek.</hi> 37. 26. Do ſpeak of this Covenant of Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diation betwixt the Father and Chriſt, this cannot, nor muſt not be granted him, ſeeing they ſpeak of a diſtinct Covenant from that; <hi>i. e.</hi> the Covenant of grace, betwixt God and his People, as is expreſs; and if he ſhould ſay this cannot be becauſe of the term <hi>everlaſting</hi> which is the Adjunct of this Covenant, and there could not be a Covenant made betwixt God and his People from everlaſting diſtinct from that which was made with Chriſt, becauſe they only have a being in time: I Anſwer, it was agreed upon from everlaſting betwixt the Father and the Son, that for the ſatisfaction of Chriſt Sinners ſhould have Pardon and Life, upon a practical Faith; <hi>i. e.</hi> a Faith (as I have before ſhewed) incluſive both of Repentance and ſincere Obedience, for all the choſen of God were given to Chriſt in his purpoſe from eternity to be brought in time to glory in this way, and upon theſe terms, and ſo in this reſpect the Covenant is everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, though the publication of it was but in time, and the actual conferring of the benefits; as the vertues of the Covenant of Redemption, and Chriſt's perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, his actual performance of the conditions of it were but in time, yet theſe did not hinder that Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant from being everlaſting.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. <hi>I believe, ſaith he, that as Chriſt was choſen and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted the Covenant head of his People, and the Covenant made with him as the perſon undertaking, ſo the Elect were therein given to him by the Father to be redeemed, as his People, Children, Seed.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>That there is a number according to the Election of Grace, I grant, and that all the Elect were given by the Father to the Son in the Covenant of Mediati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to be redeemed by him; not becauſe as he inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mates they were in his People, Children, and Seed<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                        <pb n="137" facs="tcp:31257:79"/> by meer Election, but that they might be ſo by Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption, and the participation of the benefits there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of. <hi>Epheſ. 1. 4, 5. According as he hath choſen us in him before the foundation of the world, that we ſhould be holy, and without blame before him in love. Having predeſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated us unto the adoption of Children by Jeſus Chriſt to himſelf, according to the good pleaſure of his will.</hi> Titus 2. 14. <hi>Who gave himſelf for us, that he might redeem us from all iniquity, and purifie unto himſelf a peculiar People, zealous of good works.</hi> I deny not Election, but do not lay that ſtreſs upon it, as to think the choſen of God are thereby conſtituted his People and Children, as though Redemption by Chriſt and the work of the Spirit of grace upon Souls were not neceſſary. Chriſt is the head of the Covenant of grace made betwixt God and his People in and by him, as the Purchaſer, Efficient, Author, and the great mean of conveyance of all good therein, I grant: but then that ſuch a Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant as this ſhould be made with Chriſt, this I deny; for this Covenant is a Covenant of reconciliation, and it was not Chriſt, but poor miſerable Sinners that need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed peace with God. Whatſoever this Man thinks, I am certain according to the Scripture, that the Elect themſelves before effectual vocation are enemies to God both in Heart and Life, (I ſpeak of the Adult) 1 <hi>Coloſ. 21, 22. And you that were ſometimes alienated and enemies in your mind by wicked works, yet now hath he reconciled, In the body of his fleſh through death, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent you holy, and unblameable, and unreproveable in his ſight;</hi> and if ſo (as is manifeſt) they muſt be ſo wrought upon by the bleſſed Spirit to give their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent to be ſubject to God as his Children and Servants, before God after a ſpecial ſort be reconciled to them as his Friends, and is there not implied in this their renouncing their former Maſters, the World, the Fleſh, and the Devil, and devoting themſelves to God and his ſervice ſincerely, upon which for the ſake of Chriſt, God becomes by promiſe their Sin pardoning God
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:31257:80"/> and reconciled Father, and is not here a Covenant in form ſtruck betwixt God and them? of which Chriſt though he be the head in the ſenſe mentioned above, yet he cannot be a party.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. <hi>I believe, ſaith he, the Covenant of grace was made with Chriſt the ſecond</hi> Adam, <hi>and with all the Elect in him as his Children and Seed, As the Aſſemblies Catechiſm ſaith.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>It muſt be granted him, the Aſſembly ſaith the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of Grace was made with Chriſt as the ſecond <hi>Adam,</hi> and in him with all the Elect as his Seed. But if it be as they ſay, then that which they call the Grace of God manifeſted in the ſecond Covenant in their Anſwer to the following Queſtion, muſt be given to Chriſt, for with whom a Covenant is made, of what nature ſoever the Covenant be, to him muſt be given that which is promiſed in that Covenant upon his performance of the conditions: ſo that if the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of Grace be made with Chriſt; then God muſt provide and offer to him as a Sinner a Mediator, for this is one part of the Grace of the ſecond Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, and Chriſt muſt be obliged to perform the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of this Covenant which the Aſſembly ſay is Faith to intereſt him in this Mediatour, and this Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant muſt promiſe and give the Holy Spirit to Chriſt as the Elect to work in him that Faith with all other ſaving Graces, and to enable him unto all Holy O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience, as the evidence of the truth of his Faith, and thankfulneſs to God, and as the way which he hath appointed him to Salvation. But ſeeing the Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly do apply expreſly this Grace of the ſecond Covenant to Sinners of mankind, the Covenant of Grace muſt upon a practical Faith he made with them and not with Chriſt, unleſs this Man will ſay, and prove this Reverend Aſſembly do contradict them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. And if ſo, it is a wonder he ſhould make what they ſay in this particular an Article of his Faith. I would have this conſidered by the way,
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:31257:80"/> 
                        <hi>i. e.</hi> did not Chriſt freely engage himſelf to be a Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatour, and ſo oblige himſelf to fulfil the Law of Innocency violated by Man, make himſelf a Sacrifice for Sin to ſatisfie God's Juſtice, and ſo merit Pardon and Life; now was any of mankind in this ſame Covenant, and bound under the ſame obligation with him; If any ſay yea, then they muſt be under obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation as well as Chriſt to do and ſuffer, to ſatisfie and merit Chriſt, if not, then how could Chriſt and any of mankind with him be in the ſame Covenant? for to be in the ſame Covenant, muſt needs be to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the ſame obligation. If it be ſaid Chriſt bound himſelf freely to do and ſuffer all this for us; we deny it not, but what is this to prove, That Chriſt and we were in the ſame Covenant, and ſo bound in the ſame bond? Let it be proved, that ever Chriſt was under a Covenant of Grace, and that he was dealt with in a way of Mercy, and not in a way of pure Juſtice; and will any ſay that God's diſpenſations towards his People are in a way of juſtice, and not in a way of Mercy?</p>
                     <p n="7">7. <hi>I believe, ſaith he, that as</hi> Adam <hi>was a publick Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and common head in whom his poſterity were to ſtand or fall,</hi> Rom. 5. <hi>ſo Chriſt as a common head and publick perſon is the head and Repreſentative of all the Elect in whom their ſtate and ſtanding is ſure and ſafe, ſo that they ſhall never fall nor finally periſh.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>I grant all that are given by the Father to the Son ſhall come, and that being brought over effectually they ſhall have perſevering grace. <hi>John 10. 27, 28, 29. My ſheep hear my voice, and I know them, they follow me. And I give unto them eternal life, and they ſhall never periſh, neither ſhall any pluck them out of my hand. My Father which gave them me, is greater than all; and none is able to pluck them out of my Fathers hand.</hi> And that this their ſtanding is ſecured by the merits and interceſſion of Chriſt, <hi>Luke 22. 31, 32. And the Lord ſaid,</hi> Simon, Simon, <hi>behold, Satan hath deſired to
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:31257:81"/> have you, that he may ſiſt you as wheat. But I have prayed for thee, that thy faith fail not: and when thou art converted, ſtrengthen thy brethren.</hi> And that Chriſt is the Head of his Church, which is called his Body, I deny not: But then that Chriſt was a publick Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon in ſuch a ſenſe, as that the Law of Innocency ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted what Chriſt did, the Elect did, and what he ſuffered they ſuffered, I deny; and have ſhewed the vanity of this above: And though this Man ſpeak not out plainly, yet this ſeems to be at the bottom, and the compariſon betwixt Chriſt and <hi>Adam</hi> will afford him no ſuch thing. I grant that as all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind were ſeminally in <hi>Adam</hi> as the common root, ſo in that reſpect they fell in him, as the prime progaga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor of a guilty and corrupt nature to his poſterity, to all that were to proceed from him by natural Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, yet that if <hi>Adam</hi> had ſtood, and had propa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gated an Holy Seed; that this Seed thus propagated had been ſecured in their ſtanding by their Parent ſtanding, and had not any of them fallen, this I want a word from God for its warrant, I dare not make it an Article of my Creed: Let him find me a promiſe in the Bible that runs thus, or to this purpoſe either expreſly or implicitely; <hi>Adam,</hi> if thou keep thy ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, then an Holy Seed proceeding from thee, by virtue of thy ſtanding ſhall moſt certainly ſtand too, and then I will be of the ſame Faith with him, but until then he muſt excuſe my diſſent, for this is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain to me, that though <hi>Adam</hi> had ſtood and propa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gated an Holy Seed, yet that Seed would have been under the ſame Law with their Parent, and muſt have performed in their own Perſons the ſame obedience that Law required of their Parent, or elſe the Law would have condemned them, notwithſtanding the obedience of their Parent; ſee then if his obedience would have ſecured their ſtanding without their own perſonal obedience; and that all mankind ſhould have performed a perſonal conſtant obedience to the Law
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:31257:81"/> of Innocency, ſuppoſe <hi>Adam</hi> in his own perſon had never fallen, this we want proof for. And ſo that Chriſt hath ſecured by what he hath done, and ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered the ſtate and ſtanding of all the Elect, without obedience to the Law of Grace, (I ſpeak of the Adult) <hi>i. e.</hi> though they live and die impenitent, diſobedient Infidels, I deny: for all ſuch ſhall moſt certainly be brought to Heaven in the way of Repentance, Faith, and ſincere Obedience, and the reaſon is becauſe the Lord Jeſus Chriſt hath merited this for them; but let it be proved by them that can, that <hi>Adam</hi> beſides his own Juſtification had he continued Obedient, would over and above have merited aſſuredly grace and ſtrength for the infallible ſtanding of all his po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterity, which this Man's notion, and the notion of others with him upon this point implies. Men talk againſt, and decry works of Superarogation holden by the Papiſts, and ſee not how near they come to this themſelves in attributing ſo much to a meer Man, and to his Righteouſneſs.</p>
                     <p n="8">8. <hi>I believe, ſaith be, that the Lord Jeſus Chriſt the ſecond Perſon in the bleſſed Trinity did when the fulneſs of time was come according to God's purpoſe and promiſe (for the fulfilling of the conditions, and bringing forth of the Grace and Life of this Covenant) take upon himſelf the Nature, Fleſh, and Humanity of the Elect, and become God-man, having both Natures, in the unity of his Perſon, the Godhead and Manhood.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>I grant that Chriſt the Son of God did in time take upon him Man's Nature, and united that Nature into one and the ſame Perſon with his Divine Nature: but he would have done well if he had ſhewn firſt, the difference betwixt Chriſt's Nature, Fleſh, and Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity, conſidered as Man, and ſecondly, how the Nature, Fleſh, and Humanity of the Elect differ from theſe in other Men.</p>
                     <p n="9">9. <hi>I believe, ſaith he, according to the Scriptures that as Chriſt the Covenant head of the Elect was made under the
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:31257:82"/> Law, ſo he was thus made and conſtituted in the room and ſtead of his Elect.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>There is nothing in this Article of his Creed, but what I have ſpoken to before.</p>
                     <p n="10">10. <hi>I believe, ſaith he, according to Scripture (he ſhould have ſaid ſo far as I underſtand it) that the Father by way of Imputation laid all the iniquity and ſin of the Elect upon Chriſt the Son of his love, that he was made ſin in a Curſe for them, and that he bore their ſin in his own Body upon the Tree.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>My reply is, that Chriſt who ſuffered for us was an Holy, Innocent Perſon, Holy, Harmleſs, Undefiled, ſeperate from Sinners; He knew no Sin, neither was guile found in his mouth. The Sacrifices under the Law they were to be without blemiſh, and without ſpot, and as ſuch were types of the ſinleſs purity of Chriſt the great Sacrifice. He by the eternal Spirit offered up himſelf without ſpot to God. The Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> ſaith, <hi>the juſt ſuffered for the unjuſt,</hi> and we are redeemed with the precious blood of Chriſt, <hi>as of a Lamb without blemiſh, and without ſpot.</hi> Therefore Chriſt as our Mediatour did not take our Sin upon him, ſo as to be accounted by his Father (as ſome ſay) guilty of our faults and offences; nor did God the Father account and reckon him as ſuch, indeed by his free and voluntary undertaking to ſatisfie offended juſtice for us, he obliged himſelf to ſuffer for our Sins; but he never ſo took our Sins upon him, as to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted and eſteemed by God one that was wicked, or a Sinner; for if God his Father had thus account<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him, as ſuch he muſt have hated him, but did God hate Chriſt, either in his own Perſon, or as our Sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty? Surely no. The contrary is plain; <hi>this is my be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved Son,</hi> and we are ſaid to be <hi>accepted in the beloved.</hi> He was the Holy and Juſt one in his ſufferings, yea, as our Mediatour, for he ſuffered as ſuch.</p>
                     <pb n="143" facs="tcp:31257:82"/>
                     <p>Whereas then it is ſaid, <hi>Iſaiah</hi> 53. that <hi>God laid upon him the iniquities of us all,</hi> and by the Apoſtle <hi>Peter,</hi> that <hi>he bore our Sins in his own body upon the tree,</hi> we are to underſtand by ſin and iniquity, puniſhment; for Chriſt's ſatisfactory ſufferings were a puniſhment, tho' not inflicted upon him, conſidered as a Sinner, or tranſgreſſor of any Law, but voluntarily undertaken, and ſuffered by him in our place and ſtead for the making our attonement. A puniſhment Chriſt's ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings were, but yet not with relation to any Sin in or upon himſelf, as our Mediatour: but with relation to our Sins, which were the remote occaſion and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curing cauſe of his ſuffering, though not as God did account them to be his, but as he voluntarily ſuffered for them, which would not have been, had we never ſinned. Chriſt was not immediately obliged by or upon our ſinning to ſuffer whether he would or no, as a ſurety in the ſame bond is immediately obliged in Law to diſcharge the debt whether he be willing or no in caſe of the failure of the principal Debtor. No, for it ſo, his undertaking to ſuffer would not have been in its nature voluntary and free, which undoubtedly it was. By this little, Readers, you may underſtand in what ſenſe Chriſt's ſufferings were a puniſhment, when therefore you read of our Iniquities and Sins being laid upon Chriſt, you are to underſtand that puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment which he ſuffered for us in the ſenſe above. It is like ſome Men at this day do eſteem Chriſt to have been <hi>ſtricken, ſmitten of God, and afflicted,</hi> as he was reputed by God to be the greateſt Sinner, but God tells ſuch that <hi>he was wounded for our tranſgreſſions, he was bruiſed for our iniquities, the chaſtiſement of our peace was upon him, and with his ſtripes we are healed</hi> Iſaiah 53. 3, 4, 5.

                     <p>I Anſwer. In <hi>Zechar.</hi> 14. 19. <hi>This ſhall be the puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Aegypt,</hi> the word in the <hi>Hebrew</hi> for puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

                        </gap>. And let it be obſerved, this very word tranſlated puniſhment here is the very ſame in form with that which is tranſlated Sin-offering, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noting that it was ſo called becauſe it ſuffered and was offered up for, and inſtead of the Sinner to attone for him. And thus and upon this account did Chriſt the great Sacrifice ſuffer, and was offered up, of whom all the Legal Sacrifices were types.</p>
                     <p>But it may further be ſaid, was not <hi>Aaron</hi> the High Prieſt a type of Chriſt our great High Prieſt?</p>
                     <p>I Anſwer, Yes. If ſo then, it is ſaid that <hi>Aaron</hi> as a type of Chriſt was to <hi>bear the iniquity of the holy things of the Children of Iſrael;</hi> which imports that Chriſt was to have the Sins of all the Elect charged upon him, and be accounted by God the Sinner.</p>
                     <p>I Anſwer, It is a manifeſt miſtake in this, <hi>ſc.</hi> that the Perſons of Believers are accounted by God clean, and their ſervices clean and holy, by their having the
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:31257:84"/> Sins of thoſe ſervices and duties laid and charged by God upon Chriſt, and reputed his. But it is mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt that the Perſons of Believers and their duties are accepted by God, and the Sins that attend them and their duties pardoned upon the account of Chriſt's Sacrifice, his holy Merits, and ſpotleſs Mediation and Interceſſion. If Chriſt take away the filthy garments of his People, ſo as I have ſhewn, when they approach the preſence of God, and rebuke Satan for them, I dare not ſay, let them that will, that either God or he puts them upon himſelf.

                        </gap> the ſame as to the root we have in the Text before quoted; ſo that the intent of the Holy Spirit therein comes to this; that the Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt, our great High Prieſt, and ſo our Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſor, by the ſweet Incenſe of his Mediation obtains Pardon for all the Sins and iniquities which attended the Holy things of his People; ſo that all their ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quities are hereby born away, and as it were exiled, and their ſpiritual performances made acceptable to God.

                        </gap> which ſignifies the Sin.</p>
                     <p>I grant this word in Scripture is tranſlated Sin, where it can admit of no other acceptation: But then when it is applied to that which was to be Sacrifice for Sin; if theſe our Adverſaries muſt needs have it read in the abſtract in this acceptation Sin: I would have them to conſider, it may be more fitly tranſlated expiation than Sin; and the reaſon for this is, becauſe

We have indeed torn as it were the Law of God by our diſobedience, and offended the juſtice of God, now our Lord Jeſus Chriſt did not expiate or make ſatisfaction in our ſtead by ſuſtaining our Perſons as Rebellious and diſobedient, and as an offender of juſtice; but as <hi>Jacob</hi> ſuffering for us, and making full recompence. Theſe obſervations have been occaſion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be taken by me on another account, but do well ſerve my turn here.</p>
                     <p>Touching that Text by the Man I have to deal with alledged; <hi>i. e.</hi> 2 <hi>Corinth.</hi> 5. I have above ſpoken ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what unto it.</p>
                     <p>This Aſſertion that Chriſt took our Sins upon him is grounded upon a falſe ſuppoſition, which is, that Chriſt did not only take our nature upon him, but alſo our legal Perſon; <hi>i. e.</hi> our Perſons in a Law ſenſe. Now if Chriſt was the ſame Perſon in the ſenſe of the Law with Sinners: then there could be no ſuch
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:31257:85"/> thing as hath commonly been affirmed; <hi>i. e.</hi> Chriſt's active perfect obedience to the Law, for the Law of Innocency accounts us all as tranſgreſſors, and if it account Chriſt alſo a tranſgreſſor, which it muſt do, if he be the ſame Perſon with us in Law ſenſe, where then ſhall we find his active perfect obedience there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto? He that is looked upon to be of the ſame Perſon legally with him that breaks the Law cannot be look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon as a perfect obeyer and fulfiller of the Law; what can be more plain?</p>
                     <p>Touching the paſſive obedience of Chriſt, <hi>i. e.</hi> his ſufferings, if Chriſt be accounted the ſame Perſon with Sinners in the ſenſe of the Law, then his ſufferings could not be a ſatisfaction, and if not, then not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted by God for that purpoſe. And the reaſon is, if they had been the ſufferings of a Perſon accounted by God as our Mediatour a Sinner, they would have been the ſufferings of a Sinner, for God judgeth always according to truth, for the Law doth and ever did ſince the fall account us Sinners, and if Chriſt be the ſame Perſon with us in the ſenſe of the Law, then by the Law he muſt be looked upon as a Sinner, and if as a Sinner, then his ſufferings muſt be accounted by God the ſufferings of one that was a Sinner, and if ſo, how could they be a full ſatisfaction to Juſtice? But that Chriſt's ſufferings were not the ſufferings of one accounted by God a Sinner, 'tis plain from <hi>Epheſs. 5. 2. And walk in love, as Chriſt alſo hath loved us, and hath given himſelf for us, an offering and a ſacrifice to God for a ſweet ſmelling ſavour.</hi> And <hi>Hebr. 9. 14. How much more ſhall the blood of Chriſt, who through the Eternal Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit offered himſelf without ſpot to God, purge your conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence from dead works, to ſerve the living God.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But ſuppoſe I ſhould grant theſe Men what they would have; <hi>i. e.</hi> That the Lord Jeſus Chriſt did per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly obey, ſuffer, and ſatisfie in our legal Perſon, which I have proved could not be; I hope they will give me leave to ſhew them what will follow upon it,
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:31257:85"/> and after this I ſhall leave them to determine whether this notion can be right or no, if they will but follow the conduct of Scripture. If therefore the Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt did perfectly obey, ſuffer, and ſatisfie in our legal Perſon, that is, the Law accounting him the ſame Perſon with us; then it muſt follow that even the Elect themſelves in the ſenſe of the Law, did perfectly obey, ſuffer, and ſatisfie. And if they (Chriſt obeying and ſuffering in the ſenſe of the Law) did obey, ſuffer, and ſatisfie in him in their own Perſons, then theſe things muſt follow according to the Law.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. It muſt diſcharge them from all Sin, as it accounts them perfect fulfillers of it in their legal Perſon.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. It muſt diſcharge them from all obligation to puniſhment, as it accounts them to have ſuffered and ſatisfied in their legal Perſon.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. In the ſenſe of the Law of Innocency (accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to theſe Men) it muſt be injuſtice in God to charge any Elect Soul either before or after conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion with Sin, and he cannot now afflict them for Sin, but muſt be bound in the ſenſe of theſe Perſons to give Eternal Life to the Elect for perfect legal obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience performed in the account of the Law in their own Perſons, as Chriſt and they (ſay theſe Men) are one legal Perſon.</p>
                     <p>But it may be ſaid, was not Chriſt our Surety? Yes. Did he not undertake as our Surety to ſatisfie for our Sins? Yes. And was not Sin debt? No. It was that which brought us under the obligation of ſuffering, but it was not our debt: that is a Man's debt which he is under obligation to pay, but were either we or Chriſt bound to pay Sin? I trow not.</p>
                     <p>Doth not Chriſt cry out upon the Croſs, becauſe of the Father's forſaking him? I Anſwer, though he did, this was no total withdrawment of Divine favour and love; for God loved Chriſt as our Mediatour while upon the Croſs, but a withdrawment of his ſenſible
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:31257:86"/> comforting preſence, and as a Reverend Divine ſaith, letting <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>But again ſay they, could Chriſt be afflicted in his Soul for the Sin of Man, if it was not accounted his own, and ſo laid upon him? I Anſwer, can we think that Men can be ignorant this might very well be in this caſe, and was ſo? when many of the Servants of God were greatly afflicted for the Sins and Miſeries of others, as <hi>David</hi> and <hi>Jeremiah,</hi> and thoſe that were mourners in <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> though they were not as Chriſt, to ſuffer in their ſtead for them.</p>
                     <p>If they ſay, they do not think that God accounted his Son in himſelf to be a Sinner, but as he was our Surety. I Anſwer, If God did account Chriſt as our Surety, a Sinner, and ſo guilty, pray! what did he account him guilty of as our Surety? there are theſe things in Sin, the Act, the Pollution, and the Pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhment. If then God the Father did account Chriſt as our Surety guilty of the Act, then he muſt account him the actual Sinner. If of the Pollution, then one that was morally impure in his Nature. If of the Puniſhment, ſo far as it includes his ſuffering to ſatisfie for our Sins, and make our attonement from his own free and voluntary obligation, this I grant. For if this were ſo that God the Father did account our Lord Jeſus Chriſt conſidered in relation to us as Mediatour to have been guilty of the Sins of all the Elect; then as ſuch (as I have ſaid) he muſt have been odious to God, and if ſo, how could thoſe acts reſpecting our Redemption and Reconciliation performed by him as our Surety or Mediatour have been of a ſweet ſmelling ſavour to God? It would be as much as to ſay, God the Father loved ſuperlatively his Son in himſelf: but abhorred him conſidered as Man's ſurety and Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atour; and if ſo, thoſe acts which were of the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:31257:86"/> moment, performed by him in this relation to us, ſuch as giving himſelf to be a Sacrifice, muſt have been odious to God; and if ſo, where muſt we ſtate our hopes of Salvation? It is certainly a vain and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grounded diſtinction to ſay that God accepted of the act of Obedience as they were acts of the Perſon without Sin, but condemned him as ſtanding in the relation of our Mediatour as a Sinner; <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

And if ſo be thoſe typical Sacrifices were accounted by the Lord legally moſt Holy; then undoubtedly the Antitype the great Sacrifice for expiation; <hi>i. e.</hi> our bleſſed Lord Jeſus, muſt be ſo accounted in the offering up of himſelf. As Chriſt's Righteouſneſs (ſay ſome) is imputed to us, ſo our Sins are imputed to Chriſt. They that affirm this, ſome of them ſay, that it is not only paſſive, but
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:31257:87"/> the habitual and active Righteouſneſs of Chriſt which is imputed. <hi>Pol. Syntagma.</hi> p. 457. If therefore our Sins be imputed to Chriſt, as Chriſt's Righteouſneſs in his ſenſe is imputed to us, then from this Doctrine it muſt follow, that our habitual and actual Sins muſt be imputed to Chriſt; <hi>i. e.</hi> both the corruption of our nature, and all our actual tranſgreſſions, ſeeing then that to impute ſignifies to judge, account, or reckon, the ſenſe of theſe Perſons muſt be, that God did ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count and reckon the Lord Jeſus Chriſt as our Surety or Mediatour to be both an habitual and actual Sinner, and was Chriſt ſo in God's account? Chriſt is ſaid to be made a Curſe for us, as Mr. <hi>B.</hi> ſaith, by ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as a Sacrifice for us a curſed death, not that he was under either in himſelf, or as our Mediatour a Spiritual or Eternal Curſe, or as ſome may mean, curſed by the Law as a Sinner, which is all one, for the Law of Innocency juſtified him.</p>
                     <p>11. <hi>I believe, ſaith he, that Chriſt by his obedience active and paſſive in his holy life and bitter death of the Croſs hath compleatly fulfilled the Law, and perfectly ſatisfied the offended juſtice of God for all the Elect.</hi>

                     <p>I Anſwer, Chriſt did both obey and ſuffer, he yield<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed conformity to the Law, and ſuffered and ſatisfied the offended juſtice of God for Sinners, and this in their place and ſtead. The ſufferings of Chriſt were a full ſatisfaction to an offended God, and the principal way and means for the ſecuring the Glory of his Juſtice and Holineſs, and for the manifeſtation of the Glory of his Wiſdom, and Mercy in the Salvation of Sinners: But then that Chriſt did properly fulfil by his ſufferings the threat of the Law of Innocency, which we had viola<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="153" facs="tcp:31257:87"/> the <hi>Tantundem,</hi> what did avail, yea, infinitely avail to make ſatisfaction for our offences; for any Man to ſay the Laws threat was properly and perfectly ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled in Chriſt's ſuffering, it includes a contradiction, for eternal ſufferings were included in the Laws threat; but ſeeing Chriſt's ſufferings were long ſince finiſhed, they cannot be ſaid to be eternal: Now for any Man to affirm that Chriſt properly and perfectly fulfilled the Laws threat without ſuffering ſuch a death as the Law threatned, if it be not a contradiction, it looks as like one as ever Man ſaw. But of this I ſhall ſay no more, having ſpoken of it above. Only there is this which ſeems intimated further in this Article of his Faith; <hi>i. e.</hi> that what Chriſt did and ſuffered was only for the Elect, and that others have no benefit thereby; which if intended by him, I muſt make bold to tell him, it is a great miſtake as I have alſo ſhewn above: for I do not think that any in the World enjoy any Mercy, but upon the account of Chriſt's undertaking, upon which he is ſaid to be the Saviour of all Men, though in a ſpecial diſtinguiſhing ſort of thoſe that believe.</p>
                     <p>12. <hi>I believe, ſaith he, that the obediential righteouſneſs of Chriſt is by the act of God's free grace counted, imputed, and reckoned to the Elect as the material formal cauſe of their Juſtification in the ſight of God, and yet we are not Godded with God, nor Chriſted with Chriſt, (as ſuch an one ſaith,</hi> mentioning me) <hi>for I believe, ſaith he, that in Chriſt there is four ſorts of righteouſneſs; three of which cannot without blaſphemy be ſaid to be imputed unto us. Firſt, there is the righteouſneſs of his Godhead. Secondly, Of his Manhood. They are Eſſential to his two natures and cannot be imputed. Thirdly, The righteouſneſs of both na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures united together in one Perſon, which is the righteouſneſs that qualifies, fits, and makes him meet for the Work and Office of a Mediatour, and is Eſſential to his Office as ſuch, and thus he is God's righteous Servant, Jeſus Chriſt the righteous, a faithful High Prieſt. Fourthly, There is the
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:31257:88"/> righteouſneſs of his obedience in his life and death, to the holy and juſt Law of God, and this is that righteouſneſs which is imputed to ſinners for Juſtification.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Now he hath led us into the clouds to purpoſe, here is darkneſs and confuſion with a witneſs, yea, and ſuch as we have his own teſtimony for, as will be manifeſt.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. He intimates the Elect are juſtified, but whether as ſuch only while in a ſtate of impenitency and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidelity, he tells us not. If he intend they are while in that ſtate, then they muſt be juſtified and condemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at the ſame time, for he that believes not is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned already, <hi>John</hi> 3. 18.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. He ſaith that Chriſt's Righteouſneſs is counted, imputed, and reckoned to the Elect as the material formal cauſe of their Juſtification; and yet, ſaith he, we are not Godded with God, and Chriſted with Chriſt. I grant indeed neither he nor any other whoever they be, are or ever ſhall be Goded with God, or Chriſted with Chriſt: but that this muſt be the conſequence (which is the thing I ſay) if they hold the Doctrine of being formally, perſonally Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous with Chriſt's Righteouſneſs, this I have given reaſon for above.</p>
                     <p>Touching his diſtribution of Chriſt's Righteouſneſs into four ſorts, his firſt and ſecond ſort ſuppoſeth that the humane nature of Chriſt did once exiſt ſeperate from the Divine, ſeeing he ſaith the third ſort is the righteouſneſs of both natures united. Now if the humane nature after it did exiſt, never did exiſt but in Union with the Divine; what ground can there be for this diſtinction; Firſt, The Divine Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; Second, The Humane; Third, The Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of both Natures united. I would know when and where they were diſunited after the humane na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture had once an exiſtence? I deny not that Chriſt's Righteouſneſs as God is diſtinct from his Righteouſneſs as Man, as well as humane nature is diſtinct from the
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:31257:88"/> Divine, though united in one and the ſame Perſon: But this is that I deſire to know when or where there was a Righteouſneſs of both theſe natures conſidered as exiſting diſunited? If not, to what purpoſe then is that which he calls his two firſt ſorts of Chriſt's Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs; I mean the diſtinction of his Righteouſneſs into Divine and Humane from the Righteouſneſs of both natures united? And how can he make three ſorts, go we upon his own ſuppoſition? for he ſaith there is the Righteouſneſs of Chriſt as God, and his Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs as Man, and then the Righteouſneſs of both natures united. Now if he conſider the natures as di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided, and if again as united; He hath but ſtill the Righteouſneſs of the Divine, and the Righteouſneſs of the Humane nature, which righteouſneſs is but two<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold, where now is his third ſort, or where will he find it? His fourth ſort of Chriſt's Righteouſneſs (as he calls it) is his obedience in Life and Death, and this, ſaith he, is the Righteouſneſs which is imputed: Now as he makes this a fourth ſort, and ſo ſpecifically diſtinct from the other, then this obedience of Chriſt according to him muſt neither be his righteouſneſs as Man, nor his righteouſneſs as God, nor his righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs as God and Man united; for it is blaſphemy, quoth he, to ſay that any of theſe ſorts of Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs as he calls them are imputed; and if Chriſt's Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience in Life and Death be none of theſe, what or whoſe Righteouſneſs muſt it be? it cannot (according to what he ſaith) be the Righteouſneſs of our Lord Jeſus, for he is both God and Man, and his Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs then muſt be the Righteouſneſs of that Perſon who is both God and Man: And if this Obedience in Life and Death, which he ſaith is the Righteouſneſs imputed, be neither the Obedience of the Divine, nor the Obedience of the Humane nature as he ſuppoſeth in ſeperation; nor the Obedience of the Divine and Humane nature in union, then it is manifeſt it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be Chriſt's according to his Doctrine.

Conſider, conſider, I beſeech you, you that are ſo ſtiff for ſuch an Imputation of Chriſt's Righteouſneſs as to be formally in your own Perſons righteous with it, what this Doctrine leads to, ſhut not your Eyes againſt clear light; The Lord make it a conviction unto you, when you hear that Men will have the active and paſſive obedience of Chriſt to be that they are materially and formally righteous with; and yet will not have this active and paſſive obedience to be either the righteouſneſs of Chriſt as God, or the righteouſneſs of Chriſt as Man, or the righteouſneſs of Chriſt as God and Man, and ſo to be none of Chriſt's Righteouſneſs at all. So that now according to this Man, we muſt have a righteouſneſs, and a righteouſneſs imputed for our Juſtification, which is the active and paſſive obedience of ſome Perſon, but whoſe I cannot tell, ſeeing he excludes the righteouſneſs of Chriſt as God, Man, Mediatour, ſaying it cannot without blaſphemy be ſaid to be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted to us, and without doubt the active and paſſive obedience of Chriſt was a righteouſneſs, and the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs of Chriſt God, Man, Mediatour; and ſuch a righteouſneſs as was Eſſential to his Office, ſeeing he would not have been a Mediatour without it.</p>
                     <p>But ſome may ſay Chriſt's active and paſſive obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience was eſſential to the execution of his Office as Mediatour, but not to the conſtitution.

And for this cauſe he is the Mediatour of the New Teſtament, that by means of death for the redemption of the tranſgreſſions that were under the firſt Teſtament, they which are called, might receive the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe of eternal inheritance.</hi> Heb. 7. 25. <hi>Wherefore he is able alſo to ſave them to the utmoſt, that come unto God by him, ſeeing he ever liveth to make interceſſion for them.</hi>

                     <p>I Anſwer, there cannot be the imputation of the active and paſſive obedience of Chriſt in his ſenſe with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Imputation of this, for conſider we his obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience in Life and Death, as the obedience of one who is not God, Man united, and ſo eſſentially, infinitely righteous as God, and perfectly in his nature righteous as Man, that obedience could not be the obedience of Chriſt, but if we conſider his obedience in Life and Death, as the obedience of one who is God, Man uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in one Perſon, and ſo eſſentially infinitely righteous as God, and perfectly in his nature righteous as Man; then if it be imputed in this Man's ſenſe, it muſt be imputed as the obedience of ſuch an one; and how can the righteouſneſs which conſtituted him a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="160" facs="tcp:31257:92"/> thinks another better, and therefore, for all that believe, he puts in all the Elect; perhaps he is for Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication before Faith, and ſo thinks Elect a term more agreeing to his purpoſe than believe, and he thinks not far amiſs if that be his notion; but then it might be asked from whence he had his diſpenſation for ſuch a change. I believe according to that Scripture, <hi>Acts</hi> 13. 39. that by Chriſt and his ſatisfactory and meri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious Righteouſneſs, all that truly believe <hi>are juſtified from all things, from which they could not be juſtified by the Law of</hi> Moſes; <hi>i. e.</hi> according to the Covenant of Grace, have a right to Chriſt, Pardon and Life pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſed by him, and alſo I believe the truth of that Text, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. 19. that <hi>by the obedience of one, i. e.</hi> the Obedience of Chriſt, <hi>many ſhall be made righteous,</hi> but this not by accounting the ſatisfactory and meritorious Righteouſneſs of Chriſt to be the formal Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of their Perſons, for this is proper to him as Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatour, and cannot be appropriated to them. But by this, <hi>i. e.</hi> for the ſake of this Righteouſneſs of Chriſt, all thoſe that by Faith accept him ſhall by the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of Grace be accounted Righteous, or their Faith ſhall be accepted for Righteouſneſs. <hi>Rom. 4. 5. But to him that worketh not, but believeth on him that juſtifieth the ungodly, his Faith is counted for Righteouſneſs.</hi> And whereas he adds in this Article, for it is by the Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience of one, and not by the Faith and Obedience of many, that many are juſtified, that is a meer jumble, for who ſaith that it is by the Faith and Obedience of many that others are juſtified? And who ſaith that any are juſtified without the Obedience of that one; <hi>i. e.</hi> Chriſt, giving that its proper place and office? which is to be a meritorious Righteouſneſs. And whereas they themſelves make Chriſt's Righteouſneſs to be the meritorious cauſe of our Juſtification; and yet after that make it the material cauſe, or that with which we are perſonally righteous: they themſelves affirm hereby, that juſtified Perſons are righteous in
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:31257:92"/> the ſenſe of the Law, and in God's account with the meritorious Righteouſneſs of Chriſt; and how Perſons can in God's account have a meritorious Righteouſneſs with which they themſelves are in Law-ſenſe righteous, and yet be wholly ſtripped of that in their own Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons that will merit, is a great Paradox, for Chriſt's Righteouſneſs is denominated meritorious from its in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeperable property merit, as he is our Mediatour.</p>
                     <p>14. <hi>I believe, ſaith he, that this Obedience and Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs of Chriſt imputed is as able, powerful, and certain for the Juſtification of the Elect, as the Diſobedience and Sin of</hi> Adam <hi>was for the condemnation of him and his poſterity.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>It may be doubted whether this Man do believe that thoſe he calls the Elect were of <hi>Adam</hi>'s poſterity, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that he oppoſeth them in this Article, and touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Adam</hi>'s Diſobedience and Sin which he calls his ability and power implicit for the condemnation of him and his poſterity; alas, it was his moral impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tency! if he had ſaid it was that which merited, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured the condemnation of him and his poſterity as they derived a guilty and corrupt nature from him, it had been more like and near the truth. And thus I grant that Chriſt's Righteouſneſs had infinitely more merit in it to procure Juſtification for Sinners upon their believing, than <hi>Adam</hi>'s Sin had merit to procure his own or his poſterities condemnation.</p>
                     <p>15. <hi>I believe, ſaith he, that Jeſus Chriſt by his Death, Blood, Merits, Righteouſneſs, and obedience hath purchaſed, bought, and redeemed his Elect Church and People: but that he obeyed and died to procure and purchaſe a new Law or Covenant with terms and conditions to be performed by them to give them a right and title to Juſtification. I ſee no ground as yet to believe.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Indeed I believe him, ſuch a ſtranger belike is he to the bleſſed Covenant of Grace, and yet for ſure he looks upon himſelf to be a Goſpel Preacher, if there be one in the World. In this Article further he wants
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:31257:93"/> my proof, that there is a Law or Covenant of Grace with terms and Conditions to be performed by Souls to give them a right and title to Juſtification, and this purchaſed by Chriſt. That I have already done, as he may find above, and if it would do him any good, I ſhould be glad of it.</p>
                     <p>16. <hi>I believe, ſaith he, that the ſatisfaction made by Chriſt to the Law and Juſtice of God gives the Elect a right to Juſtification and Life, in way of title, and that the Adult by Faith receive and enjoy that right.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>That Chriſt gave full-ſatisfaction to an offended God, I grant; but then that that ſatisfaction conſiſted in Chriſt's ſuffering the ſame in kind which was due to us tranſgreſſors by the Laws threat, which I ſuppoſe is that which he aims at, this I deny, and have ſhewed above it cannot be. I believe that Chriſt hath un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly purchaſed a right to Pardon and Life, which is Juſtification by his ſatisfaction and merit for all thoſe the Father hath given him: But then that any of theſe (I ſpeak of the Adult) have an actual intereſt in him, or right and title to Pardon and Life ſo long as impenitent unbelievers, this I deny, ſeeing ſo long as they remain ſuch they are in a periſhing condemned ſtate. <hi>Luke 13. 3. I tell you, Nay: but except ye repent, ye ſhall all likewiſe periſh.</hi> John 3. 18. <hi>He that believeth on him, is not condemned: but he that believeth not, is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned already, becauſe he hath not believed in the Name of the only begotten Son of God.</hi> And is it like Perſons ſhould have an actual intereſt in Chriſt, and an actual right and title to Pardon and Life by the Goſpel, ſo long as they are in a periſhing condemned ſtate in the account of the Goſpel? And then further, ſaith he, the Adult by Faith receive and enjoy this right. I ſay the Adult receive Chriſt (which receiving is not Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſical, but Moral) which conſiſts in a ſincere conſent to take Chriſt to be their Propitiation, Head and Teacher; and by this conſent which is Faith they are united to Chriſt, and have an actual right here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:31257:93"/> to the great priviledge of Adoption, which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes Pardon and Life. <hi>John 1. 12. But as many as received him to them gave he power,</hi> or the right of pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledge, or the priviledge of right <hi>to become the Sons of God,</hi> and this right is continued by our yielding that ſubjection through Grace to Chriſt which we pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed in our firſt conſent, or when we firſt did con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent to be his Servants. <hi>Revel. 22. 14. Bleſſed are they that do his commandments that they may have right to the tree of life, and may enter in through the gates into the City.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>17. <hi>I believe, ſaith he, that all thoſe thus elected and choſen and by the Father given to Chriſt, redeemed,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>are in God's appointed time, the day of his power effectually called from a ſtate of nature, ſin, and death to a ſtate of Faith, Grace, Juſtification and life: and that all thoſe who live and die in infidelity being Adult ſhall as certainly be damned as though they were in Hell already.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Mark, Reader, how he hath confirmed by thus much what I have ſaid above. But then, ſaith he, that any of the Elect being Adult ſhall live and die In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidels, ſuch an one ſpeaking of me, quoth he, hath not yet proved. That many of the Elect do live many years in Infidelity is out of doubt with me: But that any of them ſhall die Infidels, this I never ſaid nor thought, for ſaith Chriſt, <hi>John 6. 37. All that the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther giveth me, ſhall come to me: and him that cometh to me, I will no wiſe caſt out.</hi> And therefore he accuſeth me falſly.</p>
                     <p>18. <hi>I believe, ſaith he, that as one great end of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in electing, and of the Son in redeeming was the making of the Elect holy: ſo the bleſſed Spirit the third Perſon in the glorious Trinity (which is as free in working Faith, Regeneration, and Sanctification, as the Father in electing; or the Son in redeeming) doth in time make the Elect Holy, Humble, Heavenly, righteous, ſincerely Obedient, and fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful in good works contained in the firſt and ſecond table of the holy Law.</hi>

                     <p>Very good thus far, I deny not, but grant the ſame, only there is this I would have him reminded of; <hi>i. e.</hi> How it comes about, or what revelation there is for it in the word, that God will now accept of ſincere obedience to his commands through Chriſt, whereas ſinleſs perfect Obedience was once injoined Man? That it is pleaſing unto and accepted by God through Chriſt is certain, I mean ſincere Obedience to his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands: But that it ſhould be ſo without any further revelation that this is the will and command of God, beſide what was commanded <hi>Adam</hi> in Innocency, as he inſinuates when he ſaith in ſcorn he is not acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with my <hi>new Law,</hi> this reſts upon him to prove, and is like to do. It would be his mercy if God would convince him, and humble him for his deriding of that as my Law, which he muſt ſhortly know is God's Law, and that which he will judge him by.</p>
                     <p>19. <hi>I believe, ſaith he, the Elect, the redeemed and juſtified by Chriſt are under the greateſt obligation to duty both moral and poſitive in their own houſe and God's houſe, in the Church and in the World,</hi> (this Man hath words enough) <hi>And that thoſe that talk of Election and Juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by free Grace, and yet live ei<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     </p>
                     <p>Mark, Reader, upon this Article, he ſaith Article 12th, that to ſay the Righteouſneſs of Chriſt's God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head or his Manhood, or the Righteouſneſs of both his natures united is imputed is blaſphemy; and here he ſaith that Faith apprehends, embraces, and takes hold of the Righteouſneſs of Chriſt God, Man, and cloaths the Soul with it as the beſt robe, and how he will free himſelf from the heavy charge of Blaſphemy pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pronounced by himſelf, he muſt ſee to it.</p>
                     <p>Touching the Righteouſneſs of Faith ſpoken of in the forementioned Texts, the Apoſtle either ſpeaks of Faith, or wholly excludes it, if he ſpeak of and include Faith, then how can the object; <hi>i. e.</hi> only the Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:31257:95"/> of Chriſt (as he ſaith) be intended? unleſs he think that Faith goes to the conſtituting of Chriſt's Righteouſneſs, but ſurely he will not ſay this; if Faith be wholly excluded, and the Righteouſneſs of Chriſt, and only this meant, then why doth the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle mention Faith? If he ſay becauſe it takes hold up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and embraceth the Righteouſneſs of Chriſt, I ask then where this Faith is, if the Apoſtle only ſpeak of the object, Chriſt's Righteouſneſs in theſe Texts?

                     <p>21. <hi>I believe, ſaith he, that ſuch an one,</hi> naming me, <hi>chargeth many things upon I know not who, and queſtion whether he do or know; for where is the Man that ever affirmed that God reckoned that we did, and ſuffered in our own Perſons what Chriſt did and ſuffered.

                     <p>As to that which he calleth a falſe charge, thou mayſt Reader, look back unto his 12th Article, and ſee if it be not true of himſelf however: there ſaith he, it is the acts, works, doings, and obedience of this bleſſed Mediatour that are imputed and counted to the Elect for their juſtifying Righteouſneſs; ſo that from hence he may judge; If God doth account the very acts, works, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

God indeed accounts what Chriſt did and ſuffered for the good, and in the place and ſtead of and poor loſt Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners. But then doth he account them in their own Perſons in the ſenſe of any Law to have obeyed and ſuffered in Chriſt, which he muſt do, if he account the very acts, works, doings, and obedience of Chriſt as Mediatour unto them, as this Man ſaith? for if God do impute the very acts, works, doings, of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in obeying and ſuffering unto me, and reckon them as mine in themſelves: then he muſt either ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count me to have performed thoſe very acts, works, and doings in that others obeying and ſuffering, or he muſt not.

                     <p>As to this if ſome Men be guilty of ſelf contradicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, I am prone to think they did not intend it. But now theſe worthy Men, who ſay the Imputation of Chriſt's Righteouſneſs is the formal cauſe of our Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, if they mean only by God's Imputation, that God doth account the Righteouſneſs of Chriſt to be that, and that only which hath the form of a Satiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factory and Meritorious Righteouſneſs, and ſo as ſuch for which God juſtifies us upon believing, then there is no contradiction. And in the judgment of charity, I think no more was intended, notwithſtanding their unwary expreſſions which many have made but a bad uſe of: ſeeing that they have ever affirmed this Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs of Chriſt, which they call by God's Imputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion the formal cauſe of our Juſtification, to anſwer for the violation of God's Holy Law, ſatisfie God's Juſtice, remove the curſe of the Law due unto us Sinners, purchaſe Pardon and Life; and yet that none ſhall have in or an actual right unto Redemption from the curſe, ſpecial Reconciliation with God, Pardon and Salvation, but ſuch as truly believe. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore when they ſpeak of being clothed with Chriſt's Righteouſneſs, as a robe and garment, I would think they mean no more, but that it is this which is the ſcreen or ſanctuary to ſecure all true penitent believers from the execution of the Laws curſe, or the wrath of God; but then not this as it is the only Righteouſneſs of their Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, but as it is the proper and only Righteouſneſs of their Mediatour, though the bleſſed benefits hereof, as is plain, redounds to their Perſons. And thus as it was for them to remove the great evil that was due, and procure all ſaving good, ſo it is (as I have above
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:31257:98"/> expreſſed it) the formal ſatisfactory Righteouſneſs <hi>for</hi> their Perſons by God's Imputation, but then not the formal Righteouſneſs <hi>of</hi> their Perſon's by God's Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation; <hi>i. e.</hi> God doth for this Righteouſneſs of Chriſt account them upon ſuch a Faith as I have above deſcribed, perſonally righteous in the ſenſe of the Goſpel, and ſo to have intereſt in Chriſt, and a right to Pardon and Life promiſed; but then not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonally righteous with it, ſeeing, (as I have ſaid) it cannot in it ſelf after any ſort be communicated to Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers, although it be in its fruits and benefits. I think if this little which I have here inſerted was but well conſidered and our old Divines thus underſtood, the difference would not be great betwixt them, and thoſe that are called new upon the matter. But the hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ungrounded notions from the manner of expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion keeps us far from an accommodation: And if ſome Men will ſtick by ſuch notions, the conſequences we have collected from the very nature of the thing whether we will or no devolve upon them, though as to ſuch as are practical Chriſtians, their practice (as I have ſaid) muſt contradict ſuch notions, and agree with thoſe very ſame I have laid down, wherein through Chriſt is their ſafety, though yet holding ſuch notions from whence ſuch conſequences flow, I know from mine own experience, they muſt be at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended with confuſion, and act but in the dark, while yet they may think they have the greateſt light, for whatſoever the notions of a true practical Holy Chriſtian are, yet I am certain he dares not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude his intereſt in or right unto Chriſt Pardon and Life purchaſed by him any further than he hath ground of hope that he is a true penitent, ſincere obedient Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever. And ſure I am when he pleads with God for Pardon, Grace, and Acceptation, he dares not plead, as the Merit of this, any Righteouſneſs upon himſelf, or wherewith he is formally perſonally righteous with Chriſt's Righteouſneſs, yet he dare not plead this, no,
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:31257:98"/> but only the Righteouſneſs of the Mediatour Jeſus Chriſt without him, as the merit of Pardon, Grace, and acceptation, and this includes the whole that can come within a Chriſtians practice upon this matter. I dare appeal to any practical Chriſtian herein. And though this be that I hold in this point, yet ſaith this Man, if this opinion prevail, both Law and Goſpel is overthrown, truth and ſaving light extinguiſhed, and we loſe our Crown, and that which we have laboured for: This as much as if he had ſaid, that which muſt and will be found in every true and real Chriſtian's practice, if this prevail, both Law and Goſpel is over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thrown, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And not having done enough he adds, and many Holy Men of God loſe that they have la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boured for, and loſt their lives. What a Man is this, did he ever know or hear, or read of any of the Holy Men of God who loſt their lives for the oppoſing ſuch notions, the practice of which as Holy Men muſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>avoidably be found in their own practice. Let him give me an inſtance any where, at any time, of any one Holy Man of God indeed, or Woman, that loſt their lives, and ſo ſuffered Martyrdom for oppoſing this Doctrine; <hi>i. e.</hi> That true Faith unites to Chriſt, gives intereſt in him, and ſo through and for him an actual right to Pardon and Life; and that no true Chriſtian dare conclude, that he hath this union, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt, and right any further than he hath ground of hope that he is a true penitent ſincere obedient Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever; and that he dare not plead any Righteouſneſs that is in him, or upon him, as the merit of Pardon, Grace, and Acceptation, but only the Righteouſneſs of Chriſt the Mediatour without him. I ſay, let him give me but an inſtance of any one Holy Perſon in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed that ſuffered and loſt his Life, becauſe he would not comply with ſuch Doctrine as this but oppoſed it, and I profeſs and promiſe I will then believe what h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     </p>
                     <p>As to this my reply is, If I did as much contradict in opinion the Articles he mentions, as he doth that in the 27th Article of the Church of <hi>England; i. e. the Baptiſm of young Children is in any wiſe to be retained in the Church, as moſt agreeable with the Inſtitution of Chriſt,</hi> I ſhould account my ſelf no better than per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jured; look what he doth with it, ſeeing he either hath or ſhould have ſubſcribed it, I cannot tell. And as for thoſe that he mentions which he ſaith I am con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to, I challenge him or any Man elſe to ſhew me in any thing I have writ or preached that I do contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict them. As for the point in hand, I affirm with this 11th Article and agree fully with it, That it is not for the merit of our own works we are account<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed righteous before God, or for our own deſervings but only for the merit of our Lord and Saviour Jeſus Chriſt by Faith, which is the very ſame Doctrine I have been and am pleading for. I wonder what this ſame Man thought of when he writ after this ſort, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs he thought himſelf that he had a diſpenſation to write what he pleaſed, and no Man muſt examine it, though concerned ſo to do.</p>
                     <p>And then he ſaith further I am contrary to the Aſſemblies greater and leſſer Catechiſm, If he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended the whole of what is contained therein, I muſt ſay it is as grand an untruth as ever was told, and if he intended their definition of Juſtification that I am contrary to, this taken in a ſound ſenſe ſure I am he cannot prove; and ſeeing that particular Men have taken the liberty to put their own interpre<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

And let him prove if he can that his Expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition is contradictory to the Scripture. And whereas he alledgeth, I have expreſſed my ſelf formerly in this matter otherwiſe than I do now, I acknowledge the truth hereof, and have occaſion to lament, that as many others are, I was lead too much by an implicit Faith, forming notions according to the ordinary Phraſe of ſuch whoſe practice contradicted their notion in th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>s matter, (as I have ſhewn) without examining whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther or no they were concordant to the Sacred Text.</p>
                     <p>24. <hi>I believe, ſaith he, that God ſeeth no ſin in his Children and People that by Faith and Regeneration are in Chriſt, from which they are not juſtified. And here he makes a challenge! Let thoſe that hold the contrary tell me the meaning of theſe Scriptures, and he heaps up a great many, as</hi> Numb. 23. 21, &amp;c. <hi>And yet, ſaith he, God's People have daily need to confeſs their ſins, and pray for pardon.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Now here I would ask, whether they are pardoned or un<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ardoned Sins they are to confeſs and ſeek par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don for? If he ſay pardoned Sins, then it muſt be God's Peoples daily practice to acknowledge them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to be under the guilt of that Sin which they are not, and to make no other confeſſion of Sin; and alſo to crave pardon for that Sin and no other which is already pardoned, and if any can make this good they may. If he ſay that it is Sin as unpardoned they are to confeſs and crave pardon for, then there muſt be unpardoned Sin in God's Children and Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple that by Faith and Regeneration, as he ſaith, are in Chriſt, and can there be unpardoned Sin, or the
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:31257:100"/> guilt of Sin in ſuch: and God not ſee it? If ſo, then God muſt never pardon it; for God doth pardon only that which he ſees and knows to be Sin; and if God never pardon it, then the guilt muſt remain, and if the guilt ever remain, the conſequence muſt be they die bound over to Eternal puniſhment, and ſo muſt Eternally periſh, though ſuch as were by Faith and Regeneration in Chriſt.</p>
                     <p>Touching that Text which is alledged by him, and others have urged before him; <hi>i. e.</hi> Numb. 23. 21. <hi>He hath not beheld Iniquity in</hi> Jacob, <hi>neither hath he ſeen perverſeneſs in</hi> Iſrael: <hi>the Lord his God is with him, and the ſhout of a King is among them.</hi> The occaſion was, <hi>Balak</hi> would have had <hi>Balaam</hi> to have curſed <hi>Iſrael</hi> in the name of God, or to have obtained God's curſe upon them; ſaith <hi>Balaam</hi> implicitely this I cannot do, for though there be Sin in them and among them as well as in and among other People; yet God ſeeth not that Iniquity and perverſeneſs in them, for which he will ſuffer ſuch a curſe to paſs upon them as thou wouldeſt have. Now what an arguing is this of this Man which he hath from others, it is <hi>à particulari ad univerſale; i. e.</hi> becauſe God beheld not that Iniquity in <hi>Jacob,</hi> no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap> perverſeneſs in <hi>Iſrael</hi> for which he would ſuffer <hi>Balaam</hi> to curſe them, therefore he beheld and ſee no Sin at all in them. It is juſt as if a Man ſhould argue, God ſeeth no ſuch Sin in this or the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Perſon, for which they ſhould juſtly ſuffer, or be executed as Thieves or Murderers, and therefore he ſeeth no Sin at all in them. There is this further I deſire may be obſerved, this Text he alledgeth ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther refers to the whole body of the People, or but to a part; If but to a part, then <hi>Balak</hi> would but have had a part of them curſed: If to the whole body, then according to this Doctrine this Man hath from others, they muſt every individual of them have been juſtified and been in Chriſt by Faith and Regenera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and can we have ground for this, that there
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:31257:100"/> was not one Unbelieving, Unregenerate Soul then among the whole body of the People? This is not to be imagined by any.</p>
                     <p>He further quotes <hi>Pſalm 32 1, 2. Rom.</hi> 4. 5, 6, 7. but theſe I have explained already.</p>
                     <p>Another he alledgeth is <hi>Cant.</hi> 4. 7. Chriſt ſpeaking of his Church ſaith, <hi>thou art all fair, my love; there is no ſpot in thee.</hi> The meaning is, ſhe was ſo in an <hi>Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelical,</hi> but not in a <hi>Legal</hi> ſenſe, ſincerity or true grace was the prevailing Principle; and in that reſpect he accounted her (for his Merits) all fair, and without ſpot. When Chriſt ſaid concerning <hi>Nathaniel,</hi> an <hi>Iſraelite</hi> indeed, <hi>in whom is no guile,</hi> he intended no more but an upright ſincere Soul; Chriſt, ſuch is his love, he denominates his People from the better part. If therefore his meaning be that God ſeeth no Sin in his People, ſo far as they are ſincerely conformed to the Goſpel Law, this Conformity in it ſelf being no Sin, but a Righteouſneſs, or that God ſeeth no Sin which he hath fully pardoned to be unpardoned; or that God doth not ſo ſee Sin, as everlaſtingly to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn a true Believer for it in denying him Repent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, Faith, Pardon through the merits of Chriſt, I am of his mind. But then if he intended which I ſuppoſe he doth, that God ſeeth no Sin in his People, as they are accounted perſonally righteous for their Juſtification with Chriſt's Righteouſneſs, that there is any ſuch thing as this, I deny; and therefore there cannot be the other upon that account, or, for that<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> The reſt of his Texts are not to the purpoſe.</p>
                     <p>25. <hi>I believe, ſaith he, that ſuch an one,</hi> ſtill naming me, <hi>ought to let Men ſtate their own judgments, and give their own ſenſe of what they ſay and hold, and not ſtate the ſame for them, and draw his own abſurd conſequences, and fight with them againſt he knows not who.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>This is a pretty Article of a Man's Faith in the point of Juſtification; but I muſt ſay ſomething unto it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Well then either this Man's judgment (if he know
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:31257:101"/> what he holds himſelf) doth upon the matter in queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, contradict what I affirm, or it doth not; If it do not, why doth he oppoſe me?

                     <p>26. <hi>I believe, ſaith he, that that Righteouſneſs where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with God juſtifies the Elect is a Righteouſneſs which his Holy Law approves and accepts of.</hi>

                     <p>Though he make no diſtinction, yet by Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs, I take it for granted he intends the Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs of Chriſt, and by Law, the Law of Innocent Nature violated by Man's Sin. This then is that which he muſt intend, <hi>i. e.</hi> that the Law of Innocency approves and accepts of Chriſt's Righteouſneſs. Grant I muſt, that Chriſt as Man was conformed to the Law of Innocency both in Nature and Life, and that his Sufferings were in the place and ſtead of thoſe Sufferings which were due unto us in Law for our Violation thereof; and that both his active and paſſive Obedience was for us in a way of Mediation and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption. But then that either the active Obedience of Chriſt conſidered as our Mediatour was approved and accepted by this Law for that Obedience which was due unto it from us in our own Perſons, or his paſſive Obedience for thoſe ſufferings which were due unto us by this Law threat, this I deny; for this Law. knows nothing of a Mediatour for us, for if ſo, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion ſhould have been made for ſuch an one <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="181" facs="tcp:31257:102"/> Lawgiver that approves and accepts of the Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Chriſt for us as ſatisfactory and meritorious, having left himſelf a liberty to diſpence with his own Law as to the ſtrict exaction and execution of it, upon valuable conſideration given by a Mediatour whoſe Obedience ſhould be of infinite worth. For if the Law of Innocency violated by Man's Sin ſhould approve and accept Chriſt's Righteouſneſs for Sinners, as their Surety and Mediatour inſtead of that Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence they were bound to perform, then it muſt ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count them righteous in Chriſt's performance, and if it account them righteous then it muſt juſtifie them, and if it juſtifie them, it muſt account them ſuch as are ſinleſs and perfectly Holy in Nature and Life, for it will juſtifie none elſe. Let me not be miſtaken here, I deny not, but affirm that the Law of Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency did both approve and accept of the Obedience of Chriſt, or elſe he had not been juſtified by it: But then that this Law did approve and accept of this Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience of Chriſt as our Surety and Mediatour, as to account it was ſo for us, as that we obeyed in him, this I deny: For if ſo, it cannot chuſe but diſcharge us, and we muſt need no Pardon; for he cannot be ſaid to have a Pardon, that in the Laws own ſenſe and acceptation pays the whole of what it requires either by himſelf or by another the Law allowing. And he adds that the exact juſtice and free Grace of God do not only agree and kiſs each other, but that they are both exalted and glorified in the Juſtification of a Sinner. I grant him the whole of this, for <hi>it is of Faith that it might be by Grace;</hi> and it is by Faith in ſuch a way as juſtice hath full ſatisfaction, yea, and all the glorious perfections of God ſhine forth, and muſt do for ever.</p>

                     <p>To this I ſhall ſay we have all tranſgreſſed the Law, it has concluded us all under Sin, and as ſuch con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demns us, and if we be convinced, our Conſciences do and muſt accuſe us as guilty, and bear witneſs for the Laws equity in this its proceſs: ſo that there is no ſtopping the execution of the Laws ſentence by the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curing of Pardon, or an act of Grace by any thing but by the ſatisfactory and meritorious Righteouſneſs of Chriſt; and this Righteouſneſs ſhall not actually avail any for the purpoſe above, but the penitent Believer, for he that believeth not remains condemned, and he that repents not continues unforgiven as to ſpecial Pardon, as the Scripture is plain for the purpoſe. Our Conſciences then accuſing us as Sinners, for non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conformity unto, and violation of this Holy Law of God (which we muſt acknowledge ſo long as we live we are juſtly accuſed of, or elſe we muſt deny our ſelves to be Sinners, and affirm we are counted by this Law to be ſinleſs and perfectly righteous) that which muſt quiet our Conſciences here, and free us from fear and terror of having the Laws curſe inflicted as to its full and eternal extent, muſt be only the ſatisfactory and meritorious Righteouſneſs of Chriſt by which we are delivered from the execution of its curſe. But if our Conſciences accuſe us of Impeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tency and Infidelity, and ſo to be ſuch as have no actual intereſt in or right to Chriſt and his Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs for the purpoſe above ſpoken of; there is nothing can quiet our Conſciences here, or remove our fear, but our having of true Repentance and Faith found in us. But again, faith he, <hi>nor can I ſee without ſuch a Righteouſneſs how the Doctrine of Faith eſtabliſheth the Law.</hi> I grant him that without the Righteouſneſs of Chriſt, the Doctrine of Faith neither doth, nor can eſtabliſh the Law; But then how, wants explication. I ſay then upon this, Although the Doctrine of Faith, or the Doctrine of Juſtification by Faith doth make void the Law (ſuppoſe we the Law injoining perfect
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:31257:103"/> ſinleſs works) as a Covenant of Life, and ſo as an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument of our Juſtification, not from any default in it ſelf, but from our moral infirmity or weakneſs; yet the Doctrine of Faith doth not make it void as a Rule of Obedience; ſeeing the Goſpel, which is the Law of Faith, beſides its own proper precepts, hath alſo this proper unto it ſelf to injoin us ſincere Obedience to the Moral Law, which ſhall for Chriſt be accepted inſtead of ſtrict Legal perfection, and thus the Law is eſtabliſhed by Faith. But if this may not content, I ſhall ſhew him and others another way of Faiths eſtabliſhing the Law, and that is thus, God accepting now the Obedience of Faith according to the Goſpel Law (which includes ſincere Obedience to the precepts of that which is ordinarily called Moral, as we conſider Faith practical) and this for the alone ſatisfactory and meritorious Righteouſneſs of Chriſt hath hereby manifeſted, that he could not ſo diſpence with this his righteous and Holy Law, as to pardon the violation or tranſgreſſion of it without full ſatisfaction given to his governing Juſtice, which ſatisfaction he hath had, ſo that now in his juſtifying of a Sinner through Chriſt by Faith, he keeps up the repute and credit of this his Law, and ſo hath eſtab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed it as a righteous and holy Law according to the Scripture. <hi>Iſa. 42 21. The Lord is well pleaſed for his Righteouſneſs ſake, he will magnifie the Law, and make it honourable.</hi> Rom. 3. 25, 26. <hi>Whom God hath ſet forth to be a propitiation through Faith in his blood, to declare his Righteouſneſs for the Remiſſion of Sins that are paſt, through the forbearance of God, To declare, I ſay, at this time his Righteouſneſs: that he might be juſt, and the juſtifier of him which believeth in Jeſus.</hi> He concludes this Article thus; <hi>yet are we not juſtified by the Law, though in a way of Law and Juſtice; but freely by grace through the Redemption that is in Chriſt Jeſus.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>That we are juſtified freely by his Grace through the Redemption that is in Chriſt Jeſus, and alſo that
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:31257:104"/> we are not juſtified by the Law of Innocency, and yet in ſuch a way wherein God keeps up the honour of his Law in receiving full ſatisfaction for our violati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of that Law unto his governing juſtice from our Mediatour, I firmly hold, but what his meaning is, I ſhall leave, and not trouble the Reader with conjectures about it.</p>
                     <p>27. <hi>I believe, ſaith he, this Righteouſneſs whereby God graciouly juſtifies his Elect, and which they receive by Faith without wavering or violating his Holy Law reſides ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectively in the perſon of Chriſt, and yet may be ours by way of gift and Imputation without being ſubjectively in us, elſe how is God our God, Chriſt our Saviour, Redeemer, Prophet, Prieſt, and King, are theſe ſubjectively in us?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>I ſuppoſe by being ſubjectively in us, he intends that we are the Subjects; And proved I have above, that we muſt be the Subjects of Chriſt's Righteouſneſs if God account it to be the very formal Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of our Perſons.</p>
                     <p>And whereas he puts the Queſtion, how is God our God, and Chriſt our Saviour, Redeemer, Prophet, Prieſt, and King, what are theſe ſubjectively ours? I Anſwer, If he will ſay, as he ſeems to intimate, that God and Chriſt as Saviour and Redeemer in all his Offices are ours after the ſame manner that he faith Chriſt's Righteouſneſs is made ours; <hi>i. e.</hi> by God's Imputation, or his accounting it in its ſelf to be the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal Righteouſneſs of our Perſons, he implicitly ſaith this; If he will ſay that God's infinite perfections which are his Eſſence, and ſo God himſelf are made by his Imputation, or are in his account the perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of every Believers Perſon; and that Chriſt's Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices as Prophet, Prieſt, and King are made by God's Imputation, or are in God's account the Offices of every Believer's Perſon; then he muſt alſo ſay, that their Perſons in God's account are the ſubjects of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine perfections, and of Chriſt's Offices as Mediatour, which would be Blaſphemy to affirm. That God
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:31257:104"/> then is ſo in any Believer as to communicate unto, or make his Perſon a partaker of his Divine perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, or give unto him his Divine perfections in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, ſo as that it may be affirmed of his Perſon it hath Divine properties, ſuch as Omniſcience, Om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nipotency, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> to ſay this would be horrid Blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my. And ſo that Chriſt as Saviour and Redeemer is ſo in any Believer as to communicate unto, or make his Perſon the ſubject of thoſe Offices which he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf executes as Mediatour, ſo as it may be affirmed of the Believer he executes thoſe Offices in his own Perſon, is a like horrid Blaſphemy. But now I will tell this Man for all this, that it is affirmed in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, that God, Chriſt, and the Holy Spirit do dwell in the Hearts of Believers, 2 <hi>Corinth. 6. 16. And what agreement hath the Temple of God with Idols? for ye are the Temple of the living God: as God hath ſaid; I will dwell in them, and walk in them; and I will be their God, and they ſhall be my People.</hi> Epheſ. 3. 17. <hi>That Chriſt may dwell in your hearts by faith.</hi> 1 Corinth. 3. 16. <hi>Know ye not that ye are the Temple of God, and that the Spirit of God dwelleth in you?</hi> Yea, and is their God hereupon, as it may be found in the aboveſaid 2 <hi>Corinth.</hi> 6. 16. But then it is not by giving unto them after any ſort what is proper to God and Chriſt, or that whereby God is God, and Chriſt is Chriſt, and ſo incommunicable: But by giving them that which may be communicated; <hi>i. e.</hi> the effects of God's gracious and merciful Power, and the fruits of Chriſt's Mediation, ſuch as the quicken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, healing, inlarging, teaching, ſanctifying; Sin mortifying Grace of his Holy Spirit, which Grace is from the Father as the fountain through Chriſt as the Mediatour, and by the Spirit as the proxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate Author and worker, and as this Grace is wrought in them, and they after a ſpiritual ſort are quickened, healed, inlarged, taught, ſanctified, and have their Sin mortified hereby, they are the ſubjects of it.
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:31257:105"/> Now for any to talk of Chriſt's Righteouſneſs being given to them in it ſelf to be their perſonal Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs, or that Righteouſneſs wherewith their Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons are made formally righteous for their Juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and yet ſay he is the only ſubject of it, and that it is proper to him as Mediatour, and can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be communicated to any Creature, is a contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction; for if it be given to any in it ſelf to be the formal Righteouſneſs of their Perſons, it muſt be communicated to them in it ſelf; for how ſhould any Man's Perſon be formally righteous with that Righteouſneſs, which after no ſo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Chriſt indeed was given of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to reconcile God to Sinners by his Blood, and Sinners to God by the Holy Spirit given <hi>Epheſ. 2. 13.

That he hath ingaged himſelf in the Covenant of Redempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to give Grace to all the Father hath given him (I ſpeak of the Adult) to inable them to perform the duty which the Goſpel injoins, and if this be all they intend by the Covenant of Grace being made with Chriſt for Believers, they do not differ from me in the thing; though yet obſerve their notion confounds in the matter the Covenant of Redemption made with Chriſt, making it the ſame with that which is made with Sinners, which is ſtrictly in its own nature, and in the very matter of it a Covenant of Grace and Mercy. And further when they ſay the Covenant of Grace as ſuch in its own nature was made with us in Chriſt: If they mean with us in Chriſt as the purcha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſer (which this Man denies in ſcorn) or the great mean of conveyance of the bleſſings hereof; or with <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>Q. 4. <hi>If God juſtifie the Elect by a Righteouſneſs, which anſwereth not the Law of Innocency, then how doth he adminiſter grace in a way of juſtice, or what doth he juſtifie them from, or how is he juſt in juſtifying him that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieveth in Jeſus, and faithful and juſt to forgive us our Sins? ſeeing what he doth ſeems to interfere with Law and Juſtice.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>A.</hi> He ſuppoſeth firſt, That God juſtifieth the Elect, if he mean only as ſuch before Faith, and ſo without Faith, it is not true. 2ly, He ſuppoſeth that God juſtifieth by a Righteouſneſs that anſwereth the Law of Innocency. If he mean by ſuch a Righteouſneſs as is the Merit, I grant, but if he mean by ſuch a Righteouſneſs, a Righteouſneſs which we are perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally righteous with, this I deny: <hi>If God</hi> ſaith he <hi>doth not juſtifie the Elect by a Righteouſneſs which anſwereth the Law of Innocency, How then,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>doth he ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſter
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:31257:107"/> grace in a way of juſtice?</hi> I Anſwer, God doth juſtifie by that Righteouſneſs which anſwereth the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, or God's Law of Grace, (if he mean by anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a conformity to the precepts of a Law) <hi>i. e.</hi> the Righteouſneſs of Faith. And in this he adminiſters Grace in the way of Juſtice,</p>
                     <p n="1">1. As he accepts Faith for Righteouſneſs, and gives us an actual right thereupon to Pardon and Life for Chriſt's ſake, whoſe active Righteouſneſs was a confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity to the Law of Innocency, as it required ſinleſs perfect rectitude both in Nature and Life, and his Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings which are called his Paſſive Righteouſneſs, which were inſtead of the penalty due unto us for our violation of this Law, both which are meritorious and ſatisfactory on our behalf, and thus the Law is anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for us in the account of the Lawgiver, and juſtice fully ſatisfied. And thus, Readers, you muſt under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand me when I ſpeak of Chriſt's fulfilling the Law, and in what I have ſpoken of that.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. God adminiſters Grace in a way of Juſtice as he is faithful to his promiſe he hath made of Pardon and Life through Jeſus Chriſt upon our obedience to the Goſpel. And if he would know what he juſtifies from, and for what, and upon what, God tells him, <hi>Acts 13. 38, 39. Be it known unto you therefore, men and brethren, that through man is preached unto you the forgiveneſs of ſins. And by him, all that believe are juſtified from all things, from which ye could not be juſtified by the Law of</hi> Moſes. And if he would know further how he is juſt in juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying him that believeth in Jeſus. I Anſwer, Chriſt having yielded ſuch a conformity as I have ſpoken of to the Law of Innocency for us in the account of the Lawgiver, and ſatisfied the juſtice of God; his glorious attributes are ſo much honoured and advanced, and the repute of his violated Law kept up, as that God can for and upon this meritorious and ſatisfactory Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs of Chriſt without any wrong to his Juſtice, or any other his Attributes, or injury to his Holy Law,
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:31257:108"/> juſtifie the Sinner upon Faith in Chriſt, or give him an actual right according to the Law of Grace to Pardon and Life. And from what hath been ſaid it is manifeſt he is faithful and juſt in forgiving of Sin, when and where he doth forgive it, and what God doth herein according to the explication I have given neither in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terferes with Law nor Juſtice.</p>
                     <p>Q. 3. <hi>What is the Rule of this righteouſneſs of Faith, which is the formal cauſe of our Juſtification</hi> (he ſhould have added by God's imputation) <hi>for if it be a juſtifying righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs, it muſt be by ſome Rule, not the Law of Innocency for it requires a perfect righteouſneſs, but faith is an imperfect one. Then it is the new Law or Covenant that Chriſt hath purchaſed that muſt be the Rule: well then I ask, is an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect Rule, the Rule of our juſtifying righteouſneſs? or doth the ſame juſtifie by that which is imperfect? or doth this New Law juſtifie us with the allowed brea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap> of the Old? how then is it a better Covenant, or how is the Law given honoured thereby?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>In this his 5th which he calls a Queſtion he inquires firſt, what is the Rule of this Righteouſneſs of Faith, which is the formal cauſe of our Juſtification? I Anſwer, the Goſpel in which this Faith is commanded, <hi>John 20. 31. But theſe are written that ye might believe that Jeſus is the Chriſt the Son of God, and that believing ye might have life through his Name.</hi> 1 John 3. 23. <hi>And this is his Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that we ſhould believe on the Name of his Son Jeſus Chriſt, and love one another, as he gave us Commandment.</hi> And Obedience to the Goſpel is this Righteouſneſs of Faith. But ſaith he, this Faith is an imperfect Righteouſneſs; ſo it is, if the Law of Innocency which injoins ſinleſs perfect works be made the meaſure of it; but not ſo, if we bring it to the Goſpel, where it is commanded, that accepts of ſincere Obedience, and ſuch is the Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience of Faith in all God's People, for in them ſtrict legal perfection cannot be found. But to paſs on, this Man accounts the Goſpel an imperfect Rule: If com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared with the Law of Innocent nature and what it
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:31257:108"/> requires, I grant it, but that it is ſo abſolutely or in its own nature I deny, ſeeing it contains the whole of that which God wills and requires to give us intereſt in Chriſt, and a right to Eternal Salvation, by way of direction or inſtruction. Let him prove the Goſpel to be inſufficient here, and then let him ſcoff at it as the Papiſts, calling it an imperfect Rule. If he judge that what God commands in order to Salvation be imperfect, he muſt tell us what is wanting, and ſo ſee if his wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom can make up the defect. In the mean time I ſhall hold that the Righteouſneſs of Faith is perfect with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation to the Rule; <hi>i. e.</hi> the Goſpel, which it is a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity unto, our Divines have ever diſtinguiſhed of a Legal, and Evangelical perfection, but of this I have ſpoken more above. And whereas he adds in ſcorn, doth this New Law, which I call the Goſpel, juſtifie us with an allowed breach of the Old? I Anſwer, God doth not allow of Sin ſo as to approve of it in any, he being an infinite Holy God, and Sin being ſo oppoſite to this his nature: But I would have him know, Chriſt having made ſatisfaction to juſtice, God is pleaſed for the ſake of this Bleſſed Redeemer and Mediatour in his abundant Grace and Mercy to Pardon the Sins of all ſincere returners, and accept of their ſincere Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of Faith to the Goſpel inſtead of ſtrict Legal per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection. God juſtifies not, pardons not upon ſincere Repentance and Faith without a ſatisfaction given to him as Lawgiver, and when God inſiſts upon ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on for the violation of his Holy Law; and will not pardon any Sinner, though a penitent Believer, without this, when then ſatisfaction is given and accepted, if God hereupon according to the Goſpel juſtifie and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don a penitent and believing Sinner as ſuch, doth he by this juſtifie and pardon with the allowed breach of his Law? If ſo, this is as much as to ſay, God allows of Sin when for the ſake of Chriſt he juſtifies and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dons any Sinner upon ſincere Faith and Repentance. How the Lawgiver is honoured though he juſtifie by

                     <p>Q 6. <hi>Seeing Faith muſt be our formal juſtifying Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs; then I ask (ſaith he) what degree, or how many acts of Faith are required to conſtitute this Righteouſneſs that juſtifies us? Is it the faith of adherence, or the faith of aſſurance? Is it our firſt act of faith that juſtifies, or our whole life of faith, which conſiſts of many acts? If by our firſt act, then all after acts are inſignificant as as to Juſtification.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Mark here, Reader, this Man by this laſt branch grants, that not only the firſt act, but all after acts of Faith are ſignificant as to Juſtification; for he ſaith, if we are juſtified by the firſt act of Faith, then all after acts are inſignificant as to our Juſtification, which plainly implies that he accounts not only the firſt act, but all after acts of Faith to be requiſite to Juſtification, or elſe he underſtands not well what he hath writ. And thus he runs himſelf upon that which follows this with a deſign to inſnare Men; <hi>i. e.</hi> If by our whole Life of Faith (Mark, it is like the Life of Faith conſiſts only in act according to this Man, ſo that there muſt be no Life of Faith in a Soul but ſo long as it is in exerciſe) which conſiſts of many acts of Faith, then our Juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation is ſuſpended till our lives be finiſhed; then (ſaith he) where is the Man that is juſtified, or ſure that he ſhall be?</p>
                     <p>I never (and I queſtion whether any beſide this Man, and ſuch as are of his party) did before, ſee ſuch long winded complicated and confuſed Queſtions.</p>
                     <p>What a Faith it is which juſtifies, I have at large ſhewn above; And ſhall further give him to underſtand again, that Faith as it is the Souls conſent (incluſive of aſſent) to accept the Lord Jeſus as offered in the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel gives the Soul intereſt in Chriſt, and an actual right to Pardon and Life; ſo perſeverance in ſincere Obedience, which is conſent in practice (incluſive of affiance and reliance) is that which continues the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt and right. And ſo Juſtification is not a ſimula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neous
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:31257:109"/> act, but a continued act of God by his Law of Grace. <hi>Rom. 2. 7. To them who by patient continuance in well doing ſeek for glory, and honour, and immorality, eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal life. He that endureth to the end, the ſame ſhall be ſaved. Be thou faithful unto death, and I will give thee a crown of life.</hi> And that it muſt not be a ſimultaneous, but a continued act, moſt of our Divines m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>But it may be ſaid, when a believer falls into Sin, and continues for ſome time, as in the caſe of <hi>David,</hi> without Repentance, may he then be ſaid to perſevere? If not, then his juſtified ſtate ceaſeth.</p>
                     <p>I Anſwer, as to the act and exerciſe of Grace he doth not perſevere, but as to the habit of Grace he doth, which habitual Grace (as the firſt Grace gave him right) continues his right to the further exciting and quicken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Spirit, whereby he ſhall actually repent; and thus he perſevereth, and falls not totally and finally a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, neither doth he ceaſe to be in a juſtified ſtate<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                        <hi>Pſalm. 37. 24. Though he fall, he ſhall not be utterly caſt down: for the Lord upholdeth him with his hand.</hi> Jerem. 8. 4. <hi>Moreover, thou ſhalt ſay unto them, Thus ſaith the Lord, Shall they fall, and not ariſe? Shall he turn away, and not return?</hi> So that I affirm Juſtification is perfect as it is a right at the firſt; but not ſo as to the full poſſeſſion of that right, if ſo be the Perſon juſtified live for ſome time after he hath given his firſt ſincere conſent; for if a Perſon ſhould die immediately upon his firſt ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere conſent given, he moſt certainly ſhould be ſaved, but then if he live for ſome time after that, there is more required to continue his right to the the gift of further grace, and alſo of glory, and that is the performance of that which was included in his firſt conſent, as it gives him a right for Chriſt to other Covenant of priviledges, ſo alſo to this; <hi>i. e.</hi> the gift of perſevering Grace. And though this may not (as it ſeldom is) be without ſome
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:31257:110"/> actual failure; yet it never doth nor never ſhall habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually fail. And the proof of this may be drawn firſt, from the nature of true and ſaving grace. 1 <hi>Peter 1. 23. Being born again not of corruptible ſeed but of incorruptible, by the word of God, which liveth and abideth for ever.</hi> 2dly, From the perpetuity of the Covenant of grace, which all are taken into (I ſpeak of the Adult) who give a free and ſincere conſent. <hi>Jerem. 32. 40. And I will make an everlaſting covenant with them, that I will not turn away from them to do them good; but I will put my fear in their hearts, that they ſhall not depart from me.</hi> 3dly, From Chriſt's conſtant and all prevailing inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion. <hi>Hebr. 7. 25. Wherefore he is able alſo to ſave them to the uttermoſt, that come unto God by him, ſeeing he ever liveth to make interceſſion for them.</hi> Luke 22. 31, 32. <hi>And the Lord ſaid,</hi> Simon, Simon, <hi>behold Satan hath deſired to have you, that he may ſift you as Wheat: But I have prayed for thee, that thy faith fail not: and when thou art convert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, ſtrengthen thy brethren.</hi> Let not Perſons from hence gather, that ſuch may then take liberty to Sin, for this cannot be; ſeeing that ſuch a liberty would be incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent with true and ſaving Grace, and ſo with a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere conſent.</p>
                     <p>Q. 7. <hi>Seeing it is written the juſt ſhall live by Faith, what are they to truſt and live by Faith in but that which is their juſtifying Righteouſneſs? then not in Chriſt, for he is none ſuch Righteouſneſs.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>He intends that Chriſt is none ſuch Righteouſneſs in my account, and herein he is a falſe accuſer, for when or where did I aſſert, that any Perſon is juſtified with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Righteouſneſs of Chriſt; Have not I ſaid the contrary in affirming, that Faith is accepted for our Goſpel Righteouſneſs for the alone meritorious and ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfactory Righteouſneſs of Chriſt. And by the way, Reader, I would have thee take notice that the ſtrongeſt Arguments the Men of this ſtamp have for what they hold are either firſt, an implicit Faith, or ſecondly, Accuſing of thoſe that oppoſe them, as deniers of that

I Anſwer, from being the <hi>qualifying matter,</hi> I do, but not from being the <hi>meriting matter;</hi> for it cannot be that the Righteouſneſs of Chriſt ſhould be communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated to me in it ſelf, ſo as to become the qualification of my Perſon, or that which in it ſelf muſt qualifie me as a ſubject of right, or one that hath right hereby to Chriſt and his benefits.</p>
                     <p>But now whereas this Man ſaith what are they to truſt and live by Faith in but that which is their juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying Righteouſneſs, he by this muſt make our juſtifying righteouſneſs very extenſive; <hi>i. e.</hi> God and all his glorious perfections, his promiſes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> for theſe we are to truſt and live by Faith in; and if we are to truſt and live by Faith in nothing but that which is the matter of our juſtifying Righteouſneſs, then theſe muſt be the matter (according to him) of our juſtification, as well as Chriſt's Righteouſneſs, true we are to truſt and live by Faith in God's glorious perfections and his faithful promiſes through Chriſt; but though it be ſo, yet theſe are not the Righteouſneſs of Chriſt which he accounts juſtifies us as our formal Righteouſneſs, nor any part of it.

                     <p>Though I have already ſaid enough for the ſolution of this, yet there is in this which he calls a Queſtion I would have taken notice of; <hi>i. e.</hi> He ſuppoſeth, ſeeing that the ſincere grace and duties of God's People do not anſwer the Law of Innocency, nor are not a confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity in full to that Law, therefore they are morally evil; <hi>i. e.</hi> in plain terms they are no other but Sin; for he ſuppoſeth Faith to be ſo, and if Faith, then all other graces and duties. Now I grant, that although Perſons have true Faith, and performs ſincere Obedience, yet the Law of Innocency in it ſelf, or as ſuch a Law condemns them for all this (though through and for Chriſt they are delivered from a condemned ſtate, ſo as that the Laws ſentence ſhall not everlaſtingly be executed upon them, <hi>Rom. 8. 1. There is therefore now no condemnation to them which are in Chriſt Jeſus, who walk not after the
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:31257:112"/> Fleſh, but after the Spirit:</hi> And that becauſe Faith in a Redeemer and ſincere Obedience is not that confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity to this Law it calls for: But then that true Faith in a Redeemer, and ſincere in Obedience as ſuch, are morally evil in themſelves, and ſo Sin, this I deny; for they are both commanded, where then or in whomſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever they are found they are a conformity to the will of that God who commands them. And can that which is a conformity to God's command be morally evil in it ſelf, or in its own nature, and ſo Sin? If this were ſo then it would be all one for Perſons to continue diſobedient Infidels as to be obedient Believers, and this is uncouth Doctrine. Indeed neither Faith in a Redeemer or Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatour, nor yet ſincere Obedience under that formality only are commanded by the Law of Innocency, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it is ſinleſs perfect Obedience, or obedience in a Subject where is no Sin that it requires; ſeeing then that both the Faith and Obedience above ſpoken of are commanded, they muſt be commanded by ſome Law, and what Law can this be, but a Law of Mercy and Grace, which for Chriſt accepts of the ſincere obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of Faith, when God might have inſiſted upon per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect obedience in a ſinleſs ſubject. Manifeſt it is that Man (as he gathers from others) confounds Law and Goſpel, which ſets him and keeps him ſadly wrong and dark in the Doctrine of Salvation by Grace through Chriſt. And yet notwithſtanding I have ground enough to think that he judgeth himſelf to be exceeding clear in the matter, and looks upon me to be a ſilly deceived Creature, and that there is no Salvation for me, if I die an oppoſer of his confuſed notions, ſeeing that by what he ſaith in this which he calls his Queſtion, he accounts me no other than a groſs Idolater, that forms and frames a God (intending hereby the Doctrine I own) out of the forge of my own brain and imagination, calling it a golden calf, which I dance about, and call upon others to worſhip: By ſuch diſdain as this, this poor M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>Q. 13. <hi>Whether a Covenant with terms and conditions for fallen Man to perform to give him right to Juſtification and Life, be properly a Covenant of Grace, yea or nay?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>I have ſhewn there is a conditional Covenant, or a Covenant that inſiſts upon ſuch or ſuch conditions to be performed by Man through aſſiſting grace purchaſed and given, before Man have any intereſt in Chriſt, or right to Pardon and Life after an actual ſort. Texts of Scripture might be multiplied for the proof, which are very expreſs both in the Old Teſtament and New. In the Old Teſtament ſuch as <hi>Iſa.</hi> 1. 16, 17, 18. and 55. 7. <hi>Ezech.</hi> 18. 21, 22 In the New Teſtament, <hi>Luke 13. 3. John 3. 16. Acts</hi> 3. 19. 10. 43. and 13. 38, 39. God in theſe Scriptures through Chriſt offers and promiſeth Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don and Life to all penitent believing obedient Sinners, upon which then I put the Queſtion, whether Sinners (I ſpeak of the Adult) have actual pardon and right to Life after a ſpecial ſort, while yet they remain in a ſtate of impenitency and unbelief, and ſo in actual re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion againſt God: or the grant of pardon and right to life is ſuſpended until ſuch time as they by grace be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come ſincere penitent Believers. If any ſhould ſay the former, then they muſt hold that an impenitent unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving Soul, one that is and continues an actual Rebel againſt God may yet have ſpecial pardon, and an actual
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:31257:113"/> right to Salvation which is plainly repugnant to Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. If it be ſaid that theſe benefits as to the actual do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation are ſuſpended until Repentance and Faith, muſt they not then be the terms of conditions upon which theſe bleſſings are made over to Sinners? If they were not, then I ask why the actual donation or gift of them is ſuſpended until Repentance and Faith?</p>
                     <p>If it be ſaid firſt, They are no ſuch terms or condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions which Sinners as Efficient cauſes do work in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves or perform without the ſpecial concurrence and aſſiſtance of the Holy Spirit, I grant it.</p>
                     <p>If it be ſaid 2dly, They are no ſuch terms or condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, (which though they be wrought by the Holy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, and performed by the concurring aſſiſtance thereof) as are meritorious of or do purchaſe a grant and dona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the forementioned bleſſings, this I alſo grant.</p>
                     <p>If it be ſaid 3dly, That they are no ſuch terms or conditions which in their own nature procure our ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptation with God, this I as the former grant, for they themſelves are accepted of God only for the meritori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and ſatisfactory Righteouſneſs of Chriſt.</p>
                     <p>But now if Perſons will grant that God hath ſo knit and joined the bleſſings of Pardon and Life with Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance and Faith, as that none (I ſpeak of the Adult) ſhall have through Chriſt any intereſt in or actual right unto theſe benefits, but ſuch as are qualified by the Holy Spirit with this grace whereby they may turn from Sin, and give their conſent ſincerely to be the Lord's Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, and own this to be the order or method in which God through Chriſt diſpenſeth us ſaving grace, they ſay the ſame I intend, for I intend no more when I ſpeak of conditions and terms in the Covenant of grace.</p>
                     <p>And this ſame Man after he hath made a great pother and ſtir in ſtating moſt of his remaining Queſtions with reſpect to the denial of the condionality of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, yet under his 24th Queſtion, he grants, if he will ſtick to what he hath writ, that Faith is a condition of Connection and Order; ſo that if he grant thus much
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:31257:113"/> which I affirm with relation to the conditionality of the Covenant, which he muſt do or he underſtands not himſelf when he ſaith that <hi>faith is a condition of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nection and order,</hi> he owns as much the conditio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nality of the Covenant as I. And if ſo be he own con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of the Covenant of this ſort, then he muſt hold that Pardon and life, as connected to Faith do imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately according to God's appointed order in the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel devolve upon him that hath this Faith, or elſe he muſt eat his words and deny a connection. And if ſo be that theſe benefits according to God's appointed order in the Goſpel immediately devolve upon him that hath this Faith, then they muſt be promiſed unto him as ſuch an one, (and ſo they are as the Scriptures I have menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned above are expreſs) and if they be promiſed unto him as ſuch an one, then he muſt have that right to theſe bleſſings promiſed which another that wants this condition of connection and order hath not. Now then to our purpoſe I ask, is it Chriſt that this condition of connection and order reſpects, or is it a Sinner? if Chriſt, then we muſt ſuppoſe him, antecedent to this Faith, which he calls a condition of connection and order, to have been an unbeliever; if the ſinner, then this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of connection and order muſt be on his part, and not on Chriſts, and when he hath it, he muſt be a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federate and not Chriſt, according to this Man's own grant; and if the believing Sinner be one of the confede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates hereupon, then God promiſing the bleſſings that are connected with this Faith muſt be the other, and that with relation to the believing Sinner, ſeeing the bleſſings of Pardon and Life connected with his Faith reſpects him, and not Chriſt; for Chriſt himſelf need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed pardon, or a right to Life; for he never was that I can find in a guilty periſhing condition as a Sinner<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap> So that now if there be no Covenant of grace (as this Man hath affirmed) made betwixt God and Sinners, but only betwixt God and Chriſt. And yet Chriſt can be no pa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ty in this Covenant, but believing Sinners, go we
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:31257:114"/> upon his own conceſſion, how muſt theſe things be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled? or this Man be conſiſtent with himſelf? I ſhall leave it, he may ſee what he can make of it, for he hath granted a condition of the Covenant on our part, and this there cannot be without a Covenant re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecting us, which hath no relation to Chriſt as a party; <hi>i. e.</hi> in his ſenſe.</p>
                     <p>There have been many and great conteſts about this matter; <hi>i. e.</hi> ſome affirming the Covenant of grace to be abſolute, others conditional. Now in my thoughts there might be a very fair accommodation, for under a different conſideration the Covenant may be ſaid to be both abſolute and conditional: Abſolute, as the whole of the grace and ſaving benefits of it are free of meer favour through Chriſt, without reſpect to any merit or procuring deſert in us. Conditional, as God in his infinite wiſdom hath ſtated in his order of diſpenſation by Chriſt, that there ſhall be ſuch a connection or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction betwixt true Faith, Pardon and Life, as that none (I ſpeak of the Adult) ſhall have any actual inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt in or right to this Pardon and Life without Faith previous thereunto in order of nature, and whoever they are that will deny this, they muſt deny the plaineſt part of Scripture. But it may be ſaid, do not you affirm that the performance of the condition is required of us? I Anſwer, true, and the Scripture is expreſs, we are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joined to repent, believe, and obey, and not Chriſt for us; doth not this ſuppoſe us then, it may be ſaid, to have a moral power in our ſelves to repent, believe, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey antecedent to the diſpoſing and aſſiſting grace of the Spirit? I Anſwer, no, God indeed by his command makes it our duty to repent, believe and obey, his infinite wiſdom having ordered this as the beſt way or means to our having Pardon and Life through Chriſt, and therefore for this purpoſe will have the commands of the Goſpel preſſed upon Sinners. But then his promiſe of the gift of this grace through and for Chriſt to enable us hereunto ſuppoſeth our want of moral power, and ſo
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:31257:114"/> our inſufficiency and inability in our ſelves to perform, which the Spirit convinceth of: ſo that God's command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing us that which we have not in or from our ſelves to perform without the renewing and aſſiſting grace of his Spirit doth not ſuppoſe us to have the moral power of our ſelves, but it only ſpeaks God's order of acting in his diſpenſations towards Man whom he works upon as a rational Creature, who after he is convinced of his Sin and Miſery muſt be acquainted with what is his duty in this caſe; and for this God gives his command, as in the caſe of thoſe at <hi>Peter</hi>'s Sermon, and the Jaylor, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But then after acquaintance with his duty, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction of his own inability to perform, God by his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe conveys the grace of his Holy Spirit to give him that ability; ſo that now Man repenting and giving his ſincere conſent to be obedient to God in Chriſt, the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings of Pardon and Life according to the tenor of the Covenant of grace devolve upon him for Chriſt, as the ſubject of the right; <hi>i. e.</hi> as a penitent Believer. So that in what I have ſaid, it is manifeſt, the terms and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions of the Covenant performed by Man through aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting grace are no other but terms and conditions of connection and order, as hath been explained. And here obſerve, this is ſo far from deſtroying, as that it doth eſtabliſh the Doctrine of Juſtification by Faith, or that Doctrine which teacheth Faith to be our formal perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Righteouſneſs, or that upon which God doth ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count us by the Covenant of grace ſubjects that have right through Chriſt to Pardon and Life; ſeeing that God hath ſo connected true Faith and theſe ſaving be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits as that it is his fixed order by this his Covenant to diſpenſe the latter to ſuch and ſuch only (I ſpeak of the Adult) as are qualified with the former. And if ſo, then ſuch muſt have a legal right; <hi>i. e.</hi> a right in Law, and what is a right in Law, but a Righteouſneſs in the ſenſe of that Law? and ſeeing we cannot have a right in the account of the Law of Innocency, we cannot have a Righteouſneſs in the account of that Law. And if not,
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:31257:115"/> then we muſt have another Law, and this can be no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, if a Remedy as we are fallen Creatures be but a Law of Grace and Mercy; and if this muſt not be, then we muſt have no legal right at all, and if no legal right, then no Juſtification, there muſt be no ſuch thing, and if there be no ſuch thing, then let Perſons contend no more about it. And though it be true theſe conditions which are conditions of connection and order have not the Cauſality of the Efficient or meritorious cauſe, yet they have the place of the matter diſpoſing and quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying together with the form, which is God's account<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them as qualifying matter, they conſtitute the Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner a Subject that hath right according to the tenor of the Goſpel to Pardon and Life through and for Chriſt, and this is the nature of Juſtification.</p>
                     <p>But though this Man in his 24th Queſtion hath granted Faith to be a condition of connection and order (which is all that I intend, as I have explained my ſelf, when I ſpeak of the condition of the Covenant) and ſo grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed hereby a Covenant of grace made betwixt God and believers, (as I have ſhewn), yet his 14th, 15th, 16th, 17th, 18th, and 19th Queſtions, they all reſpect the ſame thing; <hi>i. e.</hi> his denial of the conditionality of the Covenant, ſo conſiſtent is this Man with himſelf; but if he had not granted what he hath, yet what I have ſaid upon the former Queſtion; <hi>i. e.</hi> his 13th may be a ſufficient ſolution to theſe I have mentioned, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I ſhall not take up time, nor fill up Paper, nor trouble the Reader with them, only ſeeing I have anſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wered him ſo many Queſtions, I will requeſt the ſame favour from him, that he will anſwer me theſe few up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the matter.</p>

                        </gap>eached to have been an error, he is to be thankful to God for that light, and to tell the People plainly of his miſtakes in that point, and thus to repent: The People likewiſe ſo far as they have light to diſcover the impertinencies of their Prayers, are to reform. Will any wiſe or good Man deny this? But now this Man ſuppoſeth in his Queſtion, that a Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter is free from error if he preach but up the Imputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Chriſt's Righteouſneſs in the ſenſe he would have it; and the People clear of impertinencies in their Prayers, if they pray but in his ſenſe for the Imputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of this Righteouſneſs, becauſe he fixeth upon this, after he hath ſpoken of the errors of the one, and the impertinencies of the other. But grant at the beſt, that he intends no more but this, that if it be an error for a Miniſter to Preach up the Imputation of Chriſt's Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs, and for People to pray for it: then Miniſters ſhould repent of this their error, and People reform in their Prayers in this particular. I Anſwer, He would bear People in hand by this that I abſolutely deny the Imputation of Chriſt's Righteouſneſs, which is falſe; for I have ſhewed that I hold it in ſix particulars ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon Scripture, that which I deny upon the point, I have again and again declared, <hi>ſc.</hi> that Chriſt's Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs is not ſo accounted by God unto us as in it ſelf to be our perſonal formal Righteouſneſs, or that our Perſons are righteous with it in it ſelf, or that God in Law ſenſe accounts what Chriſt did and ſuffered, we did and ſuffered in him, as he was a common Perſon, and our Repreſentative. Therefore whoever they are that hold ſuch an Imputation of Chriſt's Righteouſneſs as this, I look upon it as an error and miſtake in the notion, though ſuch may be right in their practice act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing contradictory thereunto, as I have ſhewn.</p>
                     <p>And touching that which he adds, <hi>i. e.</hi> of being found in Chriſt, this is no other but by union with him, and this union (as the moſt of our Divines have acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed)
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:31257:117"/> is by Faith. But when he ſpeaks of praying for the Imputation of this Righteouſneſs, he either means till they have ſome ground of hope that it is imputed: or they are to pray for it in ordinary, after they have this ground of hope that it is imputed.

I do believe, that what Chriſt did and ſuffered, he did and ſuffered for us in the Perſon of a Mediatour; and God doth account what he did and ſuffered as Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatour, doth and ſhall avail as much for the obtaining of Pardon and Life for us upon Faith, as though we had been able to have done and ſuffered the ſame in our own Perſons.</p>
                     <p>Now, Reader, compare, and be judge whether <hi>Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheſter</hi>'s Articles and mine in this point of Imputation do ſo agree as this Man hath the modeſty to affirm; and if thou be ſuch an one as Calumniations have weight with, thou mayſt have enough in him.</p>
                     <p>But further, ſaith he, the Martyrs before named ſeal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the contrary Doctrine with their deareſt Blood; <hi>i. e.</hi> the Doctrine contrary to mine as well as that of <hi>Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheſter</hi>'s, for this he muſt chiefly intend in affirming <hi>Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheſter</hi>'s and mine; <hi>i. e.</hi> my ſix things before mentioned do ſo agree, that I in them do not exceed nor aſcribe more to the grace of God and the merits of Chriſt than <hi>Wincheſter</hi> doth in his. Be it known then unto all Men, That if this Man, or any other for him, can find me any one either in the Scripture, or in that which hath been accounted the Church of Chriſt by the Reformed ſince the Apoſtles times, that was reckoned a faithful Servant of God, and yet ſealed, as ſuch, a Doctrine contradictory to what is contained in the ſix particulars with his <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

<pb n="217" facs="tcp:31257:124"/> if ſo, then ſuch an one ſhould have holden and this agreeable to the Scriptures, and the common ſuffrage of the Church of Chriſt, That Chriſt's ſatisfactory and meritorious Righteouſneſs was not nor is not accounted by God to have been for our Redemption and Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, nor to have been the ſole purchaſe and merit of the new Covenant and the benefits of it together with the Holy Spirit, nor to be that for which God accepts of the graces and duties of his People, nor to be that for which God pardons and receives penitent believing Souls into favour, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Let him prove now if he can that <hi>Barnes, Hierome,</hi> and <hi>Garret,</hi> ſealed ſuch a Doctrine thus contradictory to mine with their deareſt Blood. <hi>Hierome</hi> and <hi>Garret</hi> agreed with <hi>Barnes</hi> in the Doctrine of Faith, and we find <hi>Barnes</hi> affirming, that good works are to be done, and they that do them not ſhall not come into the Kingdom of God; and we find him only excluding them from Juſtification and Salvation in point of merit, making Chriſt and the death of Chriſt only meritorious of theſe. Wherein now do I contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict theſe Holy Martyrs in this. And whereas he ſaith that theſe Men ſealed the Doctrine contrary to <hi>Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheſter</hi>'s (and ſo to mine which he would make to be of the ſame piece with his) with their deareſt Blood, he inſinuates the cauſe of their Death to have been known unto them, when yet they themſelves enquired after the cauſe and could have no account as to any particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar in this matter of which this Man ſpeaks. But he hath not done yet, I muſt have another caſt of his Office before he leave this his Queſtion; and that is, that really and in truth he doubts whether I hold any Imputation of Chriſt's Righteouſneſs at all in a Proteſtant ſenſe. So that in his account he muſt be no Proteſtant that holds, that God reckons the ſatisfactory and meritorious Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs of Chriſt to have been for our Redemption and Salvation; or to have been the merit of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of Grace and the promiſed benefits thereof to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

<pb n="218" facs="tcp:31257:125"/> that holds theſe things, then thoſe that hold things con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contradictory unto them, muſt be the only Proteſtants for <hi>aut hoc aut ejus contradictorium,</hi> and who can theſe be but the <hi>Socinians.</hi> So that plain it is none are Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants with this Man but ſuch, as to this point. Thus I have done with his Interrogatories.</p>
                     <p>The next province he hath entered upon hath been to tranſcribe Mr. <hi>Troughton</hi>'s Theſes and Antitheſes, to which there is enough ſaid already in anſwer, ſo that to ſpeak to theſe particularly will be but <hi>actum agere,</hi> to do that which is already done.</p>
                     <p>But for all that Mr. <hi>Troughton</hi> hath ſaid in his Book to render the Doctrine I have been inſiſting upon, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to my weak ability vindicating, odious. Yet if I miſtake not, <hi>Page</hi> 121, ſaith he, <hi>Faith is the means where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the obedience and death of Chriſt is applied to us, not, ſaith he, by a phyſical, but a moral application giving us a right to all the benefits of them.</hi> Benefits of what? why, of Chriſt's obedience and death. So that plain it is Chriſt's Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs which he makes conſiſt in his active and paſſive obedience is not made over to us, quoth he, by phyſical application; <hi>i. e.</hi> not in it ſelf or in its own nature; but by a moral, Faith as a moral means giving us a right to all the benefits of them; <hi>i. e.</hi> of his obedience and death. And what can be more fully ſaid to our purpoſe or on our part than this. And he adds, God having promiſed Salvation upon the account of his Son's ſatisfaction to all that come to him, and believe in him, <hi>Page</hi> 122 he ſaith, there being but theſe two ways by which Man can be ſaved, either by fulfilling the Law of God: or in caſe of Sin, by fleeing unto, and truſting in the mercy of God, if ſo, then Faith muſt give the intereſt, <hi>Pag.</hi> 23. Faith is not a proper condition, but a qualification capacitating the Soul to receive benefit of Chriſt appointed by God for that uſe, and having the promiſe of ſucceſs, Man be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a rational Creature cannot be taken into God's fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour without his own conſent, nor can he be made par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taker of any promiſe without accepting of it, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

We will not differ about a term, ſeeing he fairly grants the thing; <hi>i. e.</hi> that faith is a qualification capacitating the Soul to receive benefit by Chriſt, and is a moral means giving right to the benefits of Chriſt's obedience and death, which is only made ours in its benefits hereby, by which he muſt grant an Imputation of Chriſt's Righteouſneſs to us only in its fruits and effects.</p>
                     <p>Towards the Concluſion, ſaith he, I mean the Man I have had to deal with, <hi>you may as well ſeek to rend the skin from my fleſh, as cauſe me to let go Chriſts imputed Righteouſneſs,</hi> I may not, I dare not, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> If he mean in it ſelf, he will find it neither is nor can be his ſo, neither doth God account it to us after a Phyſical ſort; and therefore he need not fear that any ſhould robb him of this, for no Man can take away that from another, that he neither hath nor is ever like to have. Chriſt's Righteouſneſs is his own, proper to him, and it is for this we have the application of ſaving good upon repentance and faith; but it is not for us to be made righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous with, in our own perſons; If it be in it ſelf for impetration, it is not in it ſelf or in its own nature for application; <hi>i. e.</hi> to be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied unto us, but only in its benefits upon Faith. Here he brings in one that reſpect and reverence forbids me to name, ſaying, Chriſt's Righteouſneſs imputed is the ſweeteſt word in all the Scriptures; yea, and ſaith this Man again, we find the Apoſtle expreſſing the ſame ten times in the 4th Chapter of the <hi>Romans,</hi> when yet there is no ſuch expreſſion in all the Bible; it is a wonder how Men dare ſay, that God in his word ſaith ſuch a thing expreſly, when yet no ſuch expreſſion is there to be found. I have made it evident that I deny not the thing in a ſound ſenſe; but ſo as ſome Men will have it, this I muſt deny for reaſons already given.</p>
                     <p>Thus I am brought nigh to the Concluſion of this work which I have endeavoured to perform according to the rule and line of the Holy Scripture. I impoſe nothing herein upon any, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                     <p>If any ſhall be offended becauſe the work is not ſo accurate nor in ſuch a fine dreſs as they think it ſhould have been, I muſt tell them. I did not ſtudy to pleaſe ſuch, but my aim was the information and edification of thoſe who deſire more ſound knowledge for practice, than the ſubtilty of wit, or the ſound of words to pleaſe the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>And whereas Readers, you may meet with the repetition of ſome things, know it was not with a deſign to fill up Paper, or make a great deal of a little; but becauſe many things did occur which did require it, ſeeing that many Perſons will ſcarce take the pains to look back to what they have had, though I have put them upon it in ſeveral parts of this work.</p>
                     <p>And my requeſt to you, Readers, whoſoever you be, is that you will not content your ſelves with the notion of truth, it is good in it ſelf, yea, and it is neceſſary to have your judgments as clear and ſound as may be; but know if this be all, you are but paſſing for all your light towards utter darkneſs.

                     <p>Sirs, Converſe with God through Chriſt by the Holy Spirit in all his ordinances is that which I beſeech you be concerned for; and though ſome deride this, yet know that all your devotion is to no purpoſe, if you live and die ſtrangers to it, for why, well, it is but cold, formal, and cuſtomary without it: it is not a living, but a dead ſervice in which perſons are and continue unacquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed what converſe with the living God means, that God who is the Infinite Ocean of good through Jeſus Chriſt. And though it is true there is not the like ſenſible enjoyment of God's quickening preſence at all times, yet it is that which a Child of God deſires, and cannot content himſelf without; and therefore when he waits upon God and finds it not ſo as he deſires, this is an affliction un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him: for this is that which he values before, and which glads his Soul above the beſt of Creature confluences, when it is enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. <hi>Pſalm 4. 6, 7.
